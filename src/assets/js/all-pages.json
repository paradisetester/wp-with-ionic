are CoconutPods?","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What are CoconutPods?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<h3 class=\"coconut_title\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/COCONUTPODS.COM\">COCONUTPODS.COM<\/a> IS COMING SEPTEMBER 1, 2017<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCoconutPods are all natural and organic, moisturizing body melts.\r\n\r\nI created this product because I was diagnosed with all kinds of autoimmune issues like thyroid disease, shingles, arthritis and, gland problems.\r\n\r\nMy skin was having all kinds of issues from feeling dry to looking crepey.\r\n\r\nI would do like most of us do and get out of the shower or bath and grab a bottle of lotion full of all kinds of chemicals.\r\n\r\nI would start applying from my neck down to the bottoms of my feet. \u00a0My skin was drenched in chemicals that I couldn't even pronounce or, that I even knew what the heck they were.\r\n\r\nOf course, I did this for years until I hit my middle forties when I got shingles. \u00a0It was a bit too early in life to get shingles as most people that have them get them later in life.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of my autoimmune journey on a down hill spiral.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease. \u00a0It's a disease where your immune system attacks your thyroid gland.\r\n\r\nI had nodules (growths in my thyroid) that had to be biopsied and still have to be once a year to check for cancer.\r\n\r\nI won't bore you with the fact that one ailment lead\u00a0to the next and the next and then, more and more medicine to treat the issues. \u00a0It was a total nightmare trying to adjust to my new life.\r\n\r\nI got tired of feeling like hell all of the time, so I decided to find out what was causing my problems.\r\n\r\nAfter reading that the types of health issues that I was going through were very common in today's environment. \u00a0Moreover, they are dramatically increasing at alarming rates.\r\n\r\nIs it the plastic in our water, chemicals in the air, pollution in our food, chemicals in our lotions?\r\n\r\nI am not a doctor or scientist, and frankly, I could research all of the reasons and write about what those folks think the problem is but, to me, it comes down to common sense.\r\n\r\nFACT:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>The skin is the largest organ of the human body.<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>In a 120 pound person, the skin;<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>Covers 3000 square inches<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>Weighs 6 pounds<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nCommon sense to me means that I begin to look around and find out what the heck was causing my issues.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I am vegetarian, work out, drink lots of water, supplement and, I have no history of any of the stuff I was going through in my family.\r\n\r\nI couldn't do much better on my food because I was already eating organic. \u00a0I only drank purified water (and wine) nothing else.\r\n\r\nI supplemented according to my yearly checkups to keep me healthy.\r\n\r\nI had no bad habits so what the heck gives?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What are CoconutPods?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<h3 class=\"coconut_title\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/COCONUTPODS.COM\">COCONUTPODS.COM<\/a> IS COMING SEPTEMBER 1, 2017<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter I had read that our skin is the largest organ of our body (next to our liver I guess), I took a good look around, and I was disturbed to see that I had a couple hundred beauty products in my bathroom.\r\n\r\nThe worse part is that I decided to read a lot of the labels. \u00a0I was beside myself. \u00a0I was a little mad at both myself and the product manufacturers.\r\n\r\nHere is why. \u00a0Mad at myself because unlike the food that I put into my body, I didn't take two seconds to check the chemicals that I let absorb into my skin and thus, into all of the organs of my body.\r\n\r\nI was mad at the manufacturers because they were using all kinds of preservatives that are known to cause hormone distruptors such as thyroid disease and Lupus and, a ton of others.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the toxic chemicals that you will want to avoid:\r\n<ul class=\"_kYe\">\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Parabens. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Synthetic colors. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Fragrance. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Phthalates. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Triclosan. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) \/ Sodium Laureth sulfate (SLES). ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Formaldehyde. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Toluene.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThese are only ten of them, and if you go deep, you will see that the beauty industry is not pretty.\r\n\r\nI took all of my products and got rid of them. \u00a0However, I still needed a way to moisturize my skin.\r\n\r\nI am one of those people that wants to use one or two products for a number of things so this is when I decided to create my own product called \"CoconutPods\" for versatile uses.\r\n\r\nI knew that there could be absolutely no chemicals or preservatives what so ever. \u00a0It had to be organic and it had to moisturize quickly and effectively.\r\n\r\nAfter doing lots of testing, I found my formula which is just five natural and organic ingredients:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Organic Shea butter<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic Cocoa butter<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic Coconut Oil<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic and local Beeswax<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic essential oils.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\nEverything is natural and won't throw your body off like traditional lotions and chemicals that are being sold to us without us knowing that many of them could be doing more harm than good.\r\n\r\nJust one CoconutPod (show picture or video below) a day from head to toe does the trick. \u00a0Most likely, you will even have some left and by all means, put it into your hair to soften and moisturize dry hair.\r\n\r\nNo bottles to carry. \u00a0No wasted product because you can't get it all out. \u00a0No chemicals that you have to worry about. \u00a0Just all natural moisturizer.\r\n\r\nIt's all about choices.\r\n<h3

The law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. \u2013 See more at: <a href=\"http:\/\/consumercal.org\/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa\/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\">http:\/\/consumercal.org\/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa\/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<\/a>\r\n<h5>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<\/h5>\r\nUsers can visit our site anonymously.\r\n\r\nOnce this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.\r\n\r\nOur Privacy Policy link includes the word \u2018Privacy\u2019 and can easily be found on the page specified above.\r\n\r\nYou will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> On our Privacy Policy Page\r\n\r\nCan change your personal information:\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> By logging in to your account\r\n\r\n<strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.\r\n\r\n<strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?<\/strong>\r\nIt\u2019s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking\r\n<h5>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)<\/h5>\r\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States\u2019 consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children\u2019s privacy and safety online.\r\n\r\nWe do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.\r\n<h5>Fair Information Practices<\/h5>\r\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.\r\n<h5>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<\/h5>\r\nWe will notify the users via in-site notification\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Within 7 business days\r\n\r\nWe also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and\/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\r\n<h5>CAN SPAM Act<\/h5>\r\nThe CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\r\n\r\n<strong>We collect your email address in order to:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Send information, respond to inquiries, and\/or other requests or questions\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Send you additional information related to your product and\/or service\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.\r\n\r\n<strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Honor opt-out\/unsubscribe requests quickly.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nIf at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022<\/strong> Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.\r\n\r\n<strong>and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.<\/strong>\r\n<h5>Contacting Us<\/h5>\r\nIf there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us using the information below.\r\n\r\nmyagingandwellness.com\r\n\r\n8546 broadway #245\r\n\r\n<strong>san antonio, texas 78217 <\/strong>us\r\n\r\nsupport@myagingandwellness.com\r\n\r\n210-422-2153\r\n\r\nLast Edited on 2016-10-23","cat_names":"","tag_names":"","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/placeholder-image.jpg"},{"id":7128,"slug":"terms-and-conditions","type":"page","title":"Terms and Conditions","content":"Last updated: September 19, 2016\r\n\r\nPlease read these Terms and Conditions (\u201cTerms\u201d, \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d) carefully before using the myagingandwellness.com website (the \u201cService\u201d) operated by my aging and wellness\/Theresa Skrobanek (\u201cus\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d).\r\n\r\nYour access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
