It's called BaeBody Vitamin C, 20 percent and BaeBody Eye Gel. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The thing about these two products is that I'm all about using anti-aging products that work and that don't cost a lot.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> I don't think that with today's technology, you need to spend a lot of money on anti-aging products. You really don't. You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars just on one product.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>So, with that being said, these products right here, I think this one is like 20 dollars and this one is like 15$. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Super good cost because let me tell you, before finding this Vitamin C, I was using SkinCeuticals and it was like 169 dollars, could be a little bit more, could be a little less, but you get it, it was really high. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That was just for one product. And then I would use their eye cream, which was about 70 dollars. So, wow, that was way too much to spend every month on just two anti-aging products.  At least for my budget \ud83d\ude31<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>The thing about this is that <g class=\"gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar\" id=\"15\" data-gr-id=\"15\">the Vitamin<\/g> C has enough of the Vitamin C antioxidant to do the job. It's got 20 percent. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need at least 15 percent to do it, so 20 percent's even better. It's got hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E in it and it works amazing. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">Like,<\/g> I said, it's 15 dollars, you can get free shipping for them and also, I've got the link here if you wanna check it out. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And then, this BaeBody Eye Gel. What is great about this is that it fights dark circles, it tightens your skin, it lightens your skin, and they've got that Matrixyl 3000 peptide in there and that is a really good peptide. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It actually anti-ages you, changes the way your skin looks, gets rid of lines, and it works amazing.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>So, these two products work together in synergy!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well worth the cost and well worth it for you to give 'em a try. So I just wanted to share with you these two wonderful products. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you get a chance, try them, you will love them.

It's sold in CVS, Walgreens, probably your local grocery store. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For many years I was using a product called TNS, it's made by SkinMedica. It has growth factors in it and it's awesome. It works amazing, but it's $200. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Actually, it's probably more than that. It started out like $95, now I see it on Amazon for almost $300. I cannot afford $300 a month for just one product. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With that being said, I always seek out to find products that actually work, not just say that they will or say that they'll change the appearance of your skin. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I want products that actually change my skin and where I see a difference, and I see a difference within 30 days, if not sooner. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was looking for growth factors, peptides, and things like that because that's what's really going to change your skin. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I found this product, it's called No7 Serum and it's called the Protect and Perfect Advanced Serum. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why this serum is so good is because it has, a proprietary ingredient, and peptide, but they also have the Matrixyl 3000 Plus peptide.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's a combination of the most powerful Matrixyl Plus of the next generation of peptides to change the skin. I just found this Matrixyl 3000 last year and I love it. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I found it in this product, which is called Baebody Eye Gel. They've got it in there too. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has really tightened my eyes. I mean, my eyes were crepey and this really, really tightened my eyes. You could get this product \u2026 I don't know if you can see it, but I'll put it on the link here. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this product, you can get it for $25, if not even cheaper, on Amazon. The reason why I also like this product is that it's in a container that you just squeeze. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's in an awesome dispenser so that air doesn't get into it, as it gets oxidized and then you lose its potency, it keeps the air out. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You just pump this and a little bit comes out and you use it on your eyes. I've even used it on my neck, it's tightened my neck. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The product in here, or the peptide in here that's making this work is called the Matrixyl 3000. It's a patented peptide and it really does work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The great thing about both of these products is you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This right here is $39 at Walgreens. I happen to be one of their point members or their members, I signed up with my phone number. So I got this for $39 and then I got another one for 50% off. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is going to last me for about three months maybe, two to three months. That's it, and that cost is like a quarter of what I would have paid for one product if I was still using the TNS product. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then you add this for your eyes, and this is $27. So both these products, this one you buy $39 and $25, you've saved so much money just by going to Walgreens and just by going on Amazon. I'll put both of these links below.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But again, the key ingredient, the active ingredient that makes both of these products work is the Matrixyl 3000 peptide. It's amazing, try it for yourself. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Use it for 30 days. This product, I'm not going to go back to TNS or all those other big brands, because this actually works really, really good. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can afford to buy two of these and use them on your face, your neck, your chest, and even the top of your hands. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> If you really want a good synergistic effect, try this Baebody Eye Gel with the same peptide for $20, $25. Both of these together in combination work amazing. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I just want to share that with you so that you would have things like this to help with you through antiaging and get better <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">skin,<\/g> and look as good as you feel. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time \ud83c\udf3a<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","videolink":"w_0QW_Mri2U","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Anti-Aging Products<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">smooth skin<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Smoother Skin<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Anti-Aging Products<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">smooth skin<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Smoother Skin<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">#No7 serum<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">anti aging products<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to look good for your age<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/No.7-Serum-Matrixyl-3000-Peptide-Review-624x523.png"},{"id":8813,"slug":"too-faced-sugar-peach-face-eye-palette-review","type":"post","title":"Too Faced Sugar Peach Face & Eye Palette Review","content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed\/youtube {\"url\":\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fT4Tt1aR13k\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/fT4Tt1aR13k\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:core-embed\/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here is my affiliate link if you want to check out the product in this video: <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2UaPpGK\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2UaPpGK<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":8815} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-11.05.09-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8815\"\/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2UaPpGK\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2UaPpGK<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->","videolink":"85DonQmhaUU","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-11.05.09-AM-624x561.png"},{"id":8795,"slug":"avalon-vitamin-c-serum-and-skin-care-for-less-money","type":"post","title":"Avalon Vitamin C Serum and skin care for less money..","content":"<!-- wp:core-embed\/youtube {\"url\":\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1ZheDu6TjGU\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/1ZheDu6TjGU\n<\/div><figcaption><br><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:core-embed\/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Here is the link for the products in this video: <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2UWnoje\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2UWnoje<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":8801,\"width\":516,\"height\":423,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2UWnoje\ufeff\"><img src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-4.14.49-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8801\" width=\"516\" height=\"423\"\/><\/a><figcaption><br><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Cz9zQy\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Cz9zQy<\/a><br><br><br><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><br><strong>Hey everyone. Welcome back!<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Today I want to talk to you about vitamin C Serum.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was using the same vitamin C for about five years and then they stopped making it. I don't know what happened, but I loved it, they stopped making it. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then when I went out to look for new vitamin C, I had the choice of some really expensive ones, like $166, to $250. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, I go through that stuff every four weeks or so, I can't afford that along with all my other products. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I just can't add another product that cost $200. It's just not feasible, it's not practical for me, and that's it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>I usually don't use cleansers and toners, because I usually use Dove soap. I've been using it for 30 years.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> I love it and it works for me. But I love vitamin C, I love how it brightens up my skin, it gets rid of my age spots, and it just makes my skin tone even. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So when I was set out to find my vitamin C, I found this brand. It's called the Avalon Organics, and I got this at Whole Foods. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You could get it at whole Foods, you could get it at my link, or you could just go on Amazon and get it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>This is amazing. It's a facial serum that's concentrated and it has no GMOs, no parabens, no sulfates, no preservatives. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's really important. Most of all, what I've learned about vitamin C is if you get air in it, it becomes oxidized and it doesn't last that long and its potency doesn't last. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So with these pumps, you pump the vitamin C in your hand, it doesn't get air back draft into it, if that's the right word for it, and it stays fresh.  We don't want it to turn orange and get oxidized.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>Let me show you what oxidation means. When I used to use other Vitamin Cs, I would get them in a dropper and every time I would take the dropper out it would fill up with air. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then after a couple\u00a0of weeks, my product was oxidized and the potency wasn't good. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>See in my video that nasty orange look? Actually, it's turning almost a dark brown and the smell is not good. I don't want to use this. I don't want a product that's going to get air in it, because its potency's going to be lost.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> That's super important, it's just as important as having enough of the active ingredient in your product.  The two main factors when we're using anti-aging products is the active ingredient and the decline of air and oxidation..\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, when I found this that has the pump, it doesn't get air in it, I loved it. It goes on really, really smooth, like water. It's not sticky at all.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think it's like $24. It's amazingly priced. You can use this every day on your face, neck, and chest, and you can feel good about it. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But on top of that, I found that they also have an intense vitamin gel cleanser and then a vitamin C toner. So add these to the serum and, wow, your skin really does change. These are only, get this, like $13, $14.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>When you buy things like SkinCeuticals and Obagi, the cleansers are like $60, $70. Their serums are like $100 to $200. All three of these things cost, let's see, maybe $30, $40 dollars!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are going to last me for about six weeks. That's a deal, because the vitamin C that I was using, I was paying like $45 to $50 just for the vitamin C by itself.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, I just wanted to show you the vitamin C that I found, and that is the Avalon Organics. The great thing is all this is organic. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No chemicals, no nothing, and it actually works really good. Then the intense vitamin C gel cleanser works amazing, and this toner works amazing. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you use it after the third or fourth time, you can actually see your skin brighten right in front of your eyes.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>I Just wanted to share that with you so you wouldn't have to spend a bunch of money on vitamin C.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> If you're looking for organic with no chemicals, this is also a <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">very<\/g> great option for you.

\/><\/a>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The Secret To A Good Skin Peel At Home<\/span><\/h1>\nHi, everyone. Today, I want to talk to you about chemical peels, skin peels that you do at home.\n\nI'm not going to talk to you about how to do them. I'll show you that in another video, but a lot of people ask me, \"How do you keep your skin so smooth?\"\n\nMy number one secret is no secret at all, and that is to do chemical peels twice a month, and that's it. Of course, moisturize and sunscreen are essential as well.\n\nSo with that being said, I have a little secret for you when you do your peels at home.\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The Secret To A Good Skin Peel At Home<\/span><\/h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.platinumskincare.com\/#_l_11m\">https:\/\/www.platinumskincare.com\/#_l_11m<\/a><\/p>\n\n\nThis is going to make all the difference. I didn't learn it until serendipitously I figured it out, but I don't want you to have to try and figure it out yourself because I went years doing this, and had I known what I know now, what I'm about to tell you, would have saved me a lot of time and money and would have given me more of an effective peel had I known this. So, I'm going to tell you what that is coming up right now.\n\nOkay, welcome back.\n\nI'm going to show you the secret to a good peel at home that you do yourself. I'm going to start with the peel that I used to use. That's this one right here. I'm not going to show you the label because I'm not really happy now with the brand. It was a good peel before I knew what I know now, and so I want to teach you a good habit instead of showing you what I did for 14 and a half years.\n\nI used to get the peel like this, and you can get a peel online. Just google it. I would get it, and I would open up the cap, I'd put it on the cotton ball, and I would do my swipes on my face. Over time, it just wasn't working as well. And so, I just chalked it up as just the peel, and I was getting used to it, and things like that. What really was happening was this was getting oxidized. I didn't know that until I tried a different peel. Okay? I tried a different peel, and I'll show you that peel and how I figured it out.\n\nEvery time I open this jar, the chemical peel would get oxidized, and it would weaken the strength of the peel. And so, my peels would not work as effective over time. I was just like, \"Well, I'm really getting used to these,\" so then I would buy another peel that was a lot stronger, and then I would use it on my face, and then I would burn my face, and then I couldn't figure out why, if I was not doing as well on the first peel, why I couldn't step it up one notch, and then start doing bad. And then that peel started getting weak, and then I'd go up and up and up.\n\nBut the real problem was my peel was getting oxidized. Air was getting into it, and it was reducing its ability to work. And so that's with any products. For instance, if you use a vitamin C or any kind of serum in these dropper bottles, you'll have an oxidized product. See, this one's already turning orange because air is gotten into it. And so, the thing is is that when you do buy your products, your skin care products, other than the peel, and I'm going to show you the difference, you want to use a pump because a pump doesn't get air in it. It pulls up the products. It spits it out and then it stops. It doesn't vacuum back in the air. It doesn't get the air like when you open up these bottles.\n\nI don't know why all these companies are selling these products in bottles rather than an airtight way to do that. I mean, if I've figured it out, they should know this.\n\nAnyways. I'm kind of wasting my money. My peels are reducing their strength and my products are too, so I don't buy any more products that get oxidized by the air because I'm really defeating the purpose, and I'm actually wasting my money because they don't work as good as they should over time.\n\nNow, with that being said, I went ahead and tried this peel right here. I've already opened it. I've used it twice. I used it last week, two weeks ago. You never want to do a peel more than every two weeks. I was wondering why it came in these little vials. Okay? I was thinking, hm, okay. So I went ahead and took it out. I used it. And it worked amazingly.\n\nWhat this is, this one right here's a TCA 30 peel. It has a little metal thing. I'm not going to open it because these, to me, are like gold, and I just ordered them. I used one and then I gave one to my sister, which she lost. So she's asking me for another one. I'm like, \"Go buy some if you can't find the one I gave you, girl.\"\n\nAnyways, you just pop off this metal part. Take the peel off, and then this is one peel. You can use this on your face, your chest, your neck, and your chest. I suggest when you start your peel for the first time, you only do your face because this skin is very, very thin, and this is very thin too, so you want to see what your face can take before you move down. And then on your face, you don't want to do more than a few passes before you, you know, you can tell how your face is going to react. And then if you do here, you only want to do one pass, and one pass. Trust me. Until you can build up a resistance, but that is another video that I'll teach you how to do peels.\n\nBut again, so this is not oxidized. Once I open it, it's oxidized, but this is made to only use one time. That's the beauty of it. So I get all the 30% strength in this. Whereas this 30%, every time I use it, it goes down, down, down, down, and I'm getting like 5%, you know, two months after I open it because this lasts for about five months, but it's not really worth it because it gets oxidized and doesn't work. It becomes just, after a while, it just feels like I'm putting water on my face or maybe a little bit of alcohol or like a burn. But this really works incredibly. I'm going to have my link here for you to check it out.\n\nBut again, when you buy products that become oxidized, they turn colors, and you're wasting your money. And so, with that being said, if you buy a peel online, don't buy the ones that can become oxidized. Buy the ones that are self-contained, and buy products in a pump, so they don't get air in them, and your skin will do a lot better, and you'll get better results.\n\nWith that being said, thank you for watching my video, and I will see you next time.

Face primers specifically for us women that have mature skin. Yes, I said mature skin, but you know what, we can make our skin look amazing. We can start by using primers, and you don't have to spend a lot of money.\n\nI have tried products anywhere from $5 to $50. But I'm here to show you what works the best and for very little, so stay tuned and we'll do that right now.\n\nOkay, so I didn't start using primers until I was 52 years. I'm in my mid-50s, and I wish I had started using them earlier because it helps with large pores, which I have, it helps with texture, which I have.\n\nI have a lot of rough texture and primers really set the tone for your foundation and they make your skin look flawless.\n\nIf you use the right primer, it won't settle into lines and wrinkles, because that can make us look worse and make us look older.\n\nSo the primers I'm gonna start with, my very first primer was Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, and I love this primer, I swear by it, I love it so much. But it's pricey, I think I paid like $40 and it doesn't last really long.\n\nUsing it every day, it probably lasted me about 30 days. I like products that work really well and don't cost a lot of money. So Fenty Beauty, if you have a lot of money to spend, good for you, but I don't because I like using a lot of products.\n\nBut if you want to try this, I suggest that you do because it's really smooth, it lasts all day, and it's just amazing. So the Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is my number two for the price.\n\nAnd then, of course, you have all these little primers that we won't go over. Like I have 10 here, so we have Malani, which you can't get at Walgreens. And I didn't like it too much, because it made my face look kinda oily. And then the NYX Hydration, well, that's supposed to be for mature skin, but it makes my skin look a little oily as well.\n\nAnd then we have another one, this is LA Color, you can get it at Walgreens, and this is like five bucks, and it was okay. I didn't really like it as much as I like Fenty Beauty, but still, I didn't wanna pay the price, right? So I'm on a mission to find a better primer.\n\nThen I went and tried the Elf Poreless. And this is pretty good, it's like $3 and I got it at Target. So this is pretty good if you just want to use it to go to the grocery store, it's three bucks, it's pretty good.\n\nAnd then, of course, I tried some other ones by Avon, and some pore fillers by NYX. And I just tried a whole bunch. I tried about 10.\n\nSo then I went into Sephora and the people that are working there, of course, they always have flawless skin and they do their makeup really well, and I asked them, \"Well, how do you get your skin to look like porcelain?\" And they said they use this Benefit primer, it's called Pore Primer. It fills the pores and makes your skin look really good, and I tried it, I really really liked it.\n\nThen after a while, I started feeling like I'm looking older, my face was looking caky and stuff. So I think this Pore Primer by Benefit, you can get it at Sephora or Ulta, it's probably more for younger skin than our older skin. So that is that.\n\nAnd then I started the Kat Von D. And this one was pretty good, but it felt a little sticky, a little heavy, and it was pretty pricey too. So these two I got at Sephora, and they're around the same price, like $40-$50, and that's a lot to spend when you have a ton of other products that you use.\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Best Primer for Mature Skin<\/span><\/h1>\nSo what did I find? Tada! My number one primer for our age is Covergirl Trublend. It's a skin primer and pore reducer. But guess what, this is a purple. They come in different correction colors, and I accidentally got a purple, I didn't know there was a correction color line. So I got this and I love this stuff, and it's like $10, and I've been using it for a month now, and I still have half of a tube here.\n\nSo I'm going to go ahead and say this Covergirl Trublend is the best primer that I have found for our age, and you can choose.\n\nYou can do your yellow color for red correction. It says the purple is for reducing pores and outbursts of maybe spots and creates a perfect canvas for a long-lasting weightless feel, and truly it does work.\n\nAnd I will not switch back to any of these primers. I actually have these and I'm only gonna use this $10. I can buy five of these for what I pay for one of these.\n\nBut a little secret here, with your primers, if you buy them, you could also use these for your legs or your arms or whatever you want and kind of put some body makeup.\n\nSo don't throw away your old primers, and you don't necessarily have to buy a $10 or a $40 primer for your body. You can just go buy the $3 elf primer at Target or Walgreens and you can use that on your arms, and then you put a little bit of foundation on there, a little bit of powder. It gives you a really nice clean smooth look if you have spots.\n\nSo with that being said, thanks for watching this video, and I will see you next time!","videolink":"j6wd6CtMb4c","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Anti-Aging Products<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Anti-Aging Products<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">#covergirl true blend skin primer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best body primer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best primer for big pores<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best primer for brown spots<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best primer for color correction<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">Best Primer for Mature Skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best primer for oily skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best primer for wrinkles<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to smooth out skin<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Untitled-design-4-copy-624x523.png"},{"id":8695,"slug":"best-dry-shampoo-for-thin-hair-%f0%9f%a4%94","type":"post","title":"Best dry shampoo for thin hair \ud83e\udd14","content":"<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Best dry shampoo for thin hair \ud83e\udd14<\/span><\/h1>\n<p>https:\/\/youtu.be\/UTNsaeb30G4<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you want to seriously get smoother skin then check out my \"Smooth Skin\" course.\u00a0 Just four quick steps to make your skin younger guaranteed!\u00a0 Click the link to watch the video:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\/p\/smooth-skin\"><span class=\"s1\"> https:\/\/how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\/p\/smooth-skin<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8770\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-2.36.22-PM-300x200.png\" alt=\"How to get smooth skin\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/> <a href=\"https:\/\/how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\/p\/smooth-skin\">How to get smooth skin<\/a>\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8761\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-300x246.png\" alt=\"7 step-by-step guide to look and feel amazing\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\" \/> <a href=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.lpages.co\/7-step-detox-guide-from-share\">7 step-by-step guide to look and feel amazing<\/a>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you want to feel better, look better and have an insane amount of energy in just 14 days!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then click the link below to get your FREE \"7 Step-by-Step Guide to and feel amazing!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.lpages.co\/7-step-detox-guide-from-share\">https:\/\/myagingandwellness.lpages.co\/7-step-detox-guide-from-share<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","videolink":"ngPcfAxE_nw","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Anti-Aging Products<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Anti-Aging Products<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">batiste dry shampoo<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best dry shampoo for all hair types<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best dry shampoo for dark hair<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best dry shampoo for fine hair<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best dry shampoo for oily hair<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">Best dry shampoo for thin hair<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">best dry shampoo for women over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">dove dry hair shampoo<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Untitled-design-4-1-624x523.png"},{"id":8691,"slug":"dhea-sr-hormone-booster-review","type":"post","title":"DHEA SR Hormone Booster Review!","content":"<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">DHEA SR Hormone Booster Review!<\/span><\/h1>\nHi guys. Today I want to talk to you about hormones. I've been lifting weights and exercising, and I haven't seen any big results. And I've even increased my weights and increased the time that I work out, and I still didn't see any results.\n\nSo I talked to my doctor, my hormone doctor, and she said to try a supplement called DHEA slow release tablets. And I thought, \"Well, I don't really want to take supplements, but I do take hormones.\" So she said this will synthesize your hormones, and therefore, you can have better testosterone, and testosterone will help you build muscle.\n\nAnd I gotta say, I've been taking these for about four months, and I'm seeing incredible results. I don't usually promote supplements or anything that you take orally because I don't believe in a lot of things, but DHEA supplement, this is 10 mg, and this brand is called ... What is this brand called? It's called DHEA SR.\n\nSo anyway, I've used lots of supplements before to do things like to work out and stuff like that and they didn't work or I got really jittery or I didn't see any results. But this really works. So if you're a woman and you are in your 40s, 50s, and beyond, and you want to work out and you want to get good results. Try this supplement, the DHEA supplement. It's called the SR, which is a slow release, so it slowly releases throughout the day. And you will see incredible results from your workout. And it will also synthesize all of your hormones like your estrogen, your progesterone, your testosterone, and all of that. It will just kind of tighten it all up and bring it all together.\n\nSo if you want something that will really, really help you just feel better and look better and overall just have better youth and hormones, try the DHEA, 10 mg, slow release supplement and it's by Clinical or you can find it anywhere else. But I find that this brand works better than anything I've ever tried. So thanks for watching, and I will see you next time \ud83d\ude00\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em><strong>If you want to feel better, look better and

Review\u00a0<\/span><\/h1>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/youtu.be\/F0nY60EXn7A<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Hey guys, today I want to talk to you about the Fascia blaster. I'm doing a remake on the previous video that I did. I actually deleted it because I didn't<\/p>\n<p>give it a fair chance.<\/p>\n<p>I reviewed it and I said it didn't work, but the truth is, the truth is! that I did not use this as I should have.<\/p>\n<p>Okay. So, why I didn't use it the way I should have? For one, I didn't follow directions.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, I didn't get any directions. There were videos that I could have watched, but \u00a0I have ADHD, so as soon as I get something in a box, I take out the product, I throw away the directions and I think I can do it without it.<\/p>\n<p>And I always have a fail \ud83d\ude0f<\/p>\n<p>So, to be fair to the Fascia blaster, I wanted to retry it and re-review it for you. So I deleted my other YouTube video, and here is what I think about this product.<\/p>\n<p>Okay. So, as I've gotten older, I have more and more cellulite on my legs, by my knees, and a bit on the back of my legs.<\/p>\n<p>I have it on my arms, and on my stomach. And so one day one of my workers told me that I should wear shirts because I have cellulite all over my arms.<\/p>\n<p>So, I was like, \"You know what? You're fired, all right.\" No, I didn't fire, but not that time \ud83e\udd14<\/p>\n<p>So anyway, I saw the Fascia Blaster on the newsfeed of Facebook and I thought, well, I'll try it. and could I buy everything on the news feed so I can review it and then show you what works so you don't have to waste your time and your money reviewing products.<\/p>\n<p>I buy everything on the news feed so I can review it and then show you what works and what doesn't so that you don't have to waste your time and your money buying products.<\/p>\n<p>So, I used the Fascia Blaster for the second time. I used it every day for a month. Now, you have to use it really aggressively and you have to use it every day. So, what I do is I use it when I get in the shower. So, I'll shower, I'll get my skin nice and warmed up, my muscles warmed up, and then as soon as I get out, I'll really use it and I use it really aggressively. I use it on my arms and it's got rid of all my cellulite. Honestly, it has. The thing about this thing is that you will get bruises for the first two weeks. I know that people will ask me, \"What happened to me? Was I being hit? What was going on at home? Did I get an accident?\" I mean, I've got so aggressive on my legs and I'll put a picture of that here.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you have to use it really aggressively and you have to use it every day. So, what I do is I use it when I get in the shower.

Did I get an accident?\" I mean, I've got so aggressive on my legs and I'll put a picture of that here.<\/p>\n<p>I got so aggressive on my legs that I couldn't even wear shorts, or a dress, or anything that showed my legs because I think I started way too aggressive.<\/p>\n<p>So, what are you going to do is you just, wherever your cellulite is, and wherever you want to elongate your muscles, you're going to take the Fascia Blaster and you're going to rub it on your skin.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have this shirt on just for this purpose, and I started using it here on my arms up here, and I got a bruise. And believe me, you just got to keep using it. Just don't use it on the bruise.<\/p>\n<p>You're going to put it on your skin. It's going to bring blood your skin, you're just going to bring it here and you're just going to rub it, rub it, rub it, rub it in the shower. And it's just going to break down that fat tissue, and it's going to give you amazing, amazing, nice smooth skin.<\/p>\n<p>As I said, it takes a couple of weeks and it takes consistency, but once you get rid of the cellulite, even if you miss a day or two, you still don't have cellulite.<\/p>\n<p>It does come back eventually if you don't use it consistently, but you can skip a day or two as I have.<\/p>\n<p>If you're going on a trip, you don't have to carry this thing around. I know they have another one they just came out with and it's like, it's small to travel with.<\/p>\n<p>It's got a handle so you don't have to have this big bulky one, but this works really good when you want to do all your legs, the back of your legs, you're behind. And I use it really aggressively on my stomach, and it has gotten rid of all of my cellulite.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><b><i>If you want to feel better, look better and have an insane amount of energy in just 14 days!<\/i><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><b><i>Then click the link below to get your FREE \"7 Step-by-Step Guide to and feel amazing!<\/i><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8761\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-300x246.png\" alt=\"7 step-by-step guide to look and feel amazing\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/If you want to feel better, look better and have an insane amount of energy in just 14 days!

href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2SsGtYC\">Nuface toning review<\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Nuface Toning Review<\/span><\/h1>\r\nI'm having a bit of a bad hair day, I don't know what's going on, it looked good when I put it up, but it's just going crazy. I have really thin hair, so it never stays up when I put it up. But I want to show you my latest and greatest little product that I've been using. It's called the Gold Trinity by Nuface, and this is a really popular thing right now.\r\n\r\nWhat it is, it's a micro-current, and it sends currents to our muscles and blood and gets it to be toned, and it says that your face is 85% more toned by using it, 80% smoother.\r\n\r\nLet's see, so anyway, I'm really bad about not reading all the directions before I do these videos, I just do them on the fly, so I apologize for that. I'm learning as I'm doing this video myself. But I've been using this for about a month, I always say that you need to use things for at least a month before you really can review them, right?\r\n\r\nSo this is, like a said, a micro-current, and it brings blood to your face. And it comes like this, you can buy it in different colors, and things like this, but one thing I wanted to warn you if you're going to use this, is there's a lot of fake ones out there. And I hate to say it, but on eBay, they have a lot of fake ones. And the way you can tell if they're fake or not is, see underneath here you see the little square that you go ahead and plug into your little charger? The fake ones, they're slanted, they're completely fake, and when you see those, you've bought a fake one.\r\n\r\nAnd then you're like, \"Well then how do I know it's fake? I have to buy it to find out if it's fake.\" If I were you I would buy this at the Dermstore, my link is going to be here, and I'll have legitimate products here for you too.\r\n\r\nI was watching a girl on YouTube and she bought a fake one, and it cost her three-hundred-and-something dollars, so you don't want to do that, I'm sure. So, again, you want the ones that have the little squares, and they're not slanted. When they're slanted you know they're fake.\r\n\r\nSo this comes in this box right here, if you order this one, you get a gel primer, you'll use this primer on your face before you do your machine. And I'll show you that in a minute. And then it comes with these prep pads, and these are awesome, they're little individual washcloths, and they've got bead texture on them, so when you use them on your face it really exfoliates your face.\r\n\r\nI love them, I love them, when I go on trips and travel a lot, which I do, I take them, and it works amazing. And they give you a little pouch to put your thing in, but you know what? I couldn't get it in there, I don't know, maybe I'm not using it for the right thing.\r\n\r\nSo again, you get this Nuface Trinity Toner, and you get the gel, and you get the little wipey, and you get the carrying case, and again, this is for micro ... and I'm going to kick myself for doing this again, it's a micro-current, I don't know why I'm saying micronutrients, maybe I'm hungry! I am hungry.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, you're going to charge this little baby, and then you're going to use it at night. And you're going to put your primer gel, your gold kind of gel on there, it's a clear gel, and then you're going to start here, you're going to turn your machine on, and it'll make a little noise.\r\n\r\nAnd I always do everything extreme, so I do it all the way to the highest level. And then on a clean face, with your gel, you're just going to put it here, and you can feel the little current. And it'll beep, it'll tell you to move it. And you just continue, continue, continue. And I don't have any gel on, and so I can really, really feel it. And it's just like little bits of little teeny shocks.\r\n\r\nIf I had the gel on there it would keep the pain off, or whatever, it's not really painful, it'll just keep that sensation from going away.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, you just keep using it all over your face and then use it on your neck and your chest and everything. The only thing I have a problem with using these kinds of machines, it takes a long time.\r\n\r\nYou can sit there and do it when you're watching TV and everything, and then hopefully you've moved it around and got it all in the right places, and you've done everything. You especially want to get up here and pull up your eyebrows, I can really feel that without the primer. And you just want to do that until it blinks. But it takes a long time if I do my face and my neck and my chest, it takes a good 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nNow on top of that, I do a couple other things, so when I do my wind-down routine at night, it takes a long time. And sometimes I don't always feel like doing it. So for these products to work consistently you have to do them consistently, every night. So if you are committed to 15 minutes, at least, to do this, it actually does work.\r\n\r\nI used to use this before when they first came out, it was a wand, and it was probably about eight years ago. And I liked it, I misplaced it, so now two months ago I bought this actually. And I like it, it tones my jaw, and I like the fact that I can do it around my eyes and it lifts my eyebrows up. And I like to do it around my cheeks, especially, because it lifts that. And then I like to go in here because I think it builds collagen in these little lines and folds right here.\r\n\r\nSo again, I just wanted to show you this Nuface little machine or little gadget, it's pretty good. And if you have the time, and you're committed for 15 minutes at least a night, and you're consistent, this is well worth it.\r\n\r\nI have a link, or you can go on Amazon, or you can go to the Dermstore, and you can get it. Or I think they have it at Ulta and Sephora. I think I paid $325 for it, yes I did. So $325 ... And I think I just broke it. Hopefully, I didn't just break it. But I think you can get these on sale sometimes, like 20% off, you're just going to have to look for coupons on Google and things like that.\r\n\r\nSo again, I would give this product a thumbs up, because it actually works if you're consistent with it. So thanks for watching, and thanks for watching all flaws, and I hope that I didn't just break this $325 machine, because it would not be the first time that I've done that. So thanks for watching, I'll talk to you next time \ud83d\ude00\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","videolink":"vcfgpcXwS_I","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">how to get firmer skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to look younger<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to tighten your cheeks<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to tighten your neck<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to tighten your skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to tone your face<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">micro current skin tightening<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">nuface toning review<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Screen-Shot-2018-12-06-at-3.19.09-PM-624x386.png"},{"id":8612,"slug":"monat-restore-leave-in-treatment-review","type":"post","title":"Monat Restore Leave-In Treatment Review","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Monat Restore Leave-In Treatment Review<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Just a quick apology!

I'm here to talk to you about getting longer eyelashes. I would love to have lash extensions. I've actually tried them a few times but I found that they're too much maintenance.\r\n\r\nI can't handle them and I do not have the patience to go lay on a bed for two hours every few weeks to get them done so I went ahead and I tried Revitalash and it works pretty well. It's about $49, you can get it at Sephora, Bed Bath and Beyond and at, Ulta.\r\n\r\nThen I thought\u00a0if I'm gonna go all the way and really try and get my eyelashes to grow I'm going to go ahead and try Latisse.\"\r\n\r\nLatisse is a prescription that you get from your dermatologist or doctor and you put it on your eyes every night and it makes your eyelashes grow.\r\n\r\nIt comes with individual little brushes and you just take the little bottle that they give you and you use one brush and you only one drop. You want to put it inside of the white line of your eye, not on the top but inside because it works better when you do that. As you blink, it will go to the bottom and you want to do both sides. Then you want to toss your disposable brush and then do this every night for about 30 days.\u00a0\u00a0Actually for life.\r\n\r\nI went to GoodRx.com \u00a0and got a coupon because this is $168 if you buy it from your regular pharmacy when you get a prescription. \u00a0I went to goodrx.com, I downloaded a coupon and, the cheapest one was to Walgreen's. \u00a0I paid $68. To be honest with you, I've been using it for about a month and I haven't really seen a big difference between Revitalash and Latisse.\r\n\r\nHow Latisse and other lash serums came about is they used to give it to people who have glaucoma. \u00a0It had a serendipity effect, their lashes grew super long after thirty plus days.\r\n\r\nLike, I said, I've been using Latisse for a month and I don't see a big difference.

I'm just not happy.\" \u00a0I asked her why. \u00a0She came back with the same answer that she didn't know. \u00a0I think this is the eye opener for me because, imagine if for twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, even sixty years of not knowing why you are unhappy.\r\n\r\nWe all have times in our lives where life hits us hard via death, illness, finances, relationship losses, job changes and so on, but, many of us deal with it and eventually we move on and pick up the pieces. \u00a0We find happiness again. \u00a0We understand that its a temporary situation and not a permanent problem.\r\n\r\nMy family didn't think like that. \u00a0No matter how many problems would come and go, they maintained this situation in their minds. \u00a0They were in a perpetual hell all of the time. \u00a0It's like their spirits were hijacked by some demonic thing that wouldn't allow them to get outside of their dark minds and for even a minute see that there was and is light and that it's not only at the end of a tunnel but always shining brightly.\r\n\r\nI couldn't help my mother and she took her life two years ago. \u00a0My little brother died from cancer which I believe manifested from his own demons that he couldn't shake. \u00a0My aunt died of the side effects of living with addiction and both my older brother and my cousin are like so many lost souls, they are homeless and walk this earth waiting for their time to go.\r\n\r\nMy aunt died of the side effects of living with addiction and both my older brother and my cousin are like so many lost souls, they are homeless and walk this earth waiting for their the next place their soul will go.\r\n\r\nMy son is trying very hard but, I see his path a dark one as he fights the good fight but is tired too. \u00a0It is the most saddening feeling when you can't even save your own mother let alone your only son.\r\n\r\nI hope that my family and all of those who suffer from being lost on this earth catch a break in the next one and their souls can feel what I feel which is happiness, joy, good and bad and know the difference between how to separate a moment and a lifetime instead feeling like walking with a thousand pound weight at all times.\r\n\r\nWe are not so different from one another. \u00a0We all have a spirit. \u00a0Young or old, we are all amazing. \u00a0We are remarkable no matter what we have or haven't accomplished. \u00a0We are going to leave this life and before we do we have to find some sense of peace and with that, hopefully, happiness.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't let the world tell us what is normal and what isn't. \u00a0We should tell the world what is normal for us. \u00a0We are our own normal and not what others expect us to be in order to fit into society.\r\n\r\nIf I can offer anyone that is suffering from depression and darkness is to not wait for your time to be up but to know that you're here to break the cycle so that you can live a happy life now.\r\n\r\nDon't delay or wait or live in \"what if\" because the road to someday is now. \u00a0Dare to be what God intended you to be. \u00a0The real pain is the sorrow we feel by not participating in the gift of life.\r\n\r\nDon't throw away your life. \u00a0 \u00a0As I think about it, what was my mothers real fear was she thought she was unworthy. \u00a0No matter what I told her she never felt otherwise and surrounded herself with men that reinforced her beliefs.\r\n\r\nYou are worthy and you are not without existence. \u00a0Don't throw away your life. \u00a0You don't have to be lost and wait this life out until whatever your soul has in store for you next. \u00a0You are supposed to be here with all of us now and that's why you were born.\r\n\r\nNo one is born better than anyone else and no one will ever be you. \u00a0Love yourself because you can't love others until you do. \u00a0When you are loved and you love back, this is the real joy and joy that will fill your soul. \u00a0No judgement. \u00a0No conditions, just letting life live through you.\r\n\r\nForgive yourself and all that you believe to be true or not to be. \u00a0Forgive others and keep walking, don't stop searching and finding your truth.\r\n\r\nYou are a miracle. \u00a0Need I say more?\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Here is a link to my book if you would like to check it out:<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qvmkoL\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qvmkoL<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8591\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Screen-Shot-2018-11-06-at-7.16.28-AM-202x300.png\" alt=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qvmkoL\" width=\"202\" height=\"300\" \/> Without Existence.

Thus Dr. Obaji\u2019s theory is that skin issues, and aging is caused by the internal factors of the body.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dr. Obaji\u2019s philosophy says the way to improve skin and maximize it\u2019s potential rather than chasing wrinkles from the outside is to in his words is \u00a0\"Restore the natural cellular activity that characterizes baby skin.\"<\/span><\/p>\r\nEssentially after thirty, we need to wake up the cells so that they can work together. \u00a0By using products that just sit on the top of our skin is a waste of our time and money. \u00a0We must use products that penetrate the skin and work in synergy to make the cells work together. \u00a0When we do this, the skin will repair itself, and its natural vitality will bring itself back.\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The future of skin care<\/span><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe future of skin care is addressing one's skin on its specific needs. \u00a0It's not going to be a one size fits all like in department stores. \u00a0For example, I have brown spots, and I have larger pores around my nose. \u00a0After the basics of cleaning, I need Vitamin C, Retin-A, and a good moisturizer. \u00a0I am also in my fifties so along with these products I also need to stimulate my skin and create collagen and elastin.\r\n\r\nThe future of skin care is treating skin at the cellular level. \u00a0Everyone's skin is different and has different needs. \u00a0As we age, our skin care needs will change, and skin care must be adjusted so that it corrects, restores and maintains our specific requirements to stay naturally healthy for the rest of our lives.\r\n\r\nThe future of skin care is\u00a0to address the needs of the skin. Thus, we prevent aging. \u00a0The younger we start, the less we will need invasive procedures like facelifts. \u00a0Preservation is the key to anti-aging.\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Dr. Obaji's Skin Care Recommendations\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDaily:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>\u00a0Clean your skin and remove all impurities.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Stimulate your skin and clean your pores so that bacteria, oil, and makeup won't live in your pores. \u00a0(I use the\u00a0\u00a0Clarisonic Mia 2, 2 Speed Facial Sonic Cleansing Brush):*\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2ClDMDB\">\u00a0https:\/\/amzn.to\/2ClDMDB<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Eliminate\u00a0dead cells. \u00a0One of the first signs of aging is the accumulation of dead skin cells. \u00a0(Retin-A is the number one thing to use for cell turnover). \u00a0If you do nothing else, use Retin-A!<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nIf you think that your skin is sensitive, Dr. Obaji says that there is no such thing. \u00a0He states that the real term is, \"Our skin is weak.\" \u00a0We must strengthen our skin as the skin is capable of wearing anything.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The moisturizer myth<\/span><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf we listen to all of the beauty and lotion companies, we are told and sold on the idea that we need more and more moisturizer. \u00a0These companies have ingrained in our psyche\u00a0that we can't get enough moisturizer. \u00a0Dr. Obaji says differently. \u00a0He says that if we use too much moisturizer, then we send signals to our body by telling it to stop producing its moisturizer and thus, drying out our skin even more. \u00a0Our body compensates for what we do. \u00a0Basically, if we do all the work for our skin, we allow it to get lazy.\r\n\r\nDiet is an important part of skin care. \u00a0With that said, our diet can only convert so much that will contribute to our skin's ability to renew and regenerate itself. \u00a0Things like Vitamin A and antioxidants we can't get enough through our diets. \u00a0DNA is the brain of our cells so taking into consideration that we do need to use a skin system or steps if you will that are for our specific skin type. \u00a0Way too often we buy products because of marketing and smell. \u00a0This is not the way to use skin care because it doesn't work unless it addresses the stages of life that we are at.\r\n\r\nWe have to use skin care that has science behind it. \u00a0When using a good skincare system, we must know our skin type and know that our skin changes with age. \u00a0Many of us, including me, don't know our skin type. \u00a0For so long I thought I had oily skin. \u00a0I found out that I do not. \u00a0I have more normal and dry. \u00a0So, for fifty years I was using the wrong products, and I \u00a0wondered why my skin wasn't changing.\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Stimulating Your Skin<\/span><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe best way to get your skin to create the new skin from the inside out is to stimulate your skin. \u00a0Using products like Retin-A will enable your skin to create collagen and elastin, two vital building blocks for younger and healthy skin. \u00a0Some may think that we could eat a whole bunch of Vitamin A and then get enough in our bodies to create enough collagen and elastin, but we don't synthesize Vitamin A, so we need to use Vitamin A on our skin to activate it.\r\n\r\nVitamin C is another fantastic way to make our skin stronger and fight free radicals with antioxidants. \u00a0Vitamin C also removes and prevents hyperpigmentation (brown or age spots).\r\n\r\nOur skin is naturally supposed to be smooth. \u00a0Our skin should be even toned, strong, and naturally hydrated. \u00a0When we achieve and maintain these features, we have healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWill, we age and get loose skin? \u00a0Yes and no. \u00a0The sooner that we get on a scientific program that is based on our skin type, we can achieve natural and beautiful skin forever.\r\n\r\nJust a quick note here. \u00a0I would love to use the Obaji skin care system. However, I find it to be too expensive for me. \u00a0Most of us can't afford to use multiple hundred dollar products each month.\r\n\r\nHere is the basic minimum that I do:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>\u00a0*Clarisonic brush (<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2RZNXmG\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2RZNXmG<\/a>) \u00a0and Dove soap or a mild cleansing gel from your local drug store.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Toner (I use Oil of Olay).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>*Vitamin C Serum (<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2pXw9vs\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2pXw9vs<\/a>)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Any eye cream made specifically for the eyes. \u00a0With today's technology, all eye creams are good!<\/li>\r\n \t<li>*A growth factor to repair and stimulate new collagen and elasticity. \u00a0The Obaji growth factor is way too expensive for me so I've been using TNS for several years and it works great. However, it's not cheap. \u00a0It used to be under $100.00, but now it's a bit more. \u00a0Here is my link (<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2CjajtT\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2CjajtT<\/a>). \u00a0Quick cheat way to get your growth factors and not pay a lot is to go to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/skinactives.com\/\">https:\/\/skinactives.com<\/a>\u00a0(I have no affiliation with them) the lady that owns the company is a chemist and sells some pretty powerful products at very good prices. \u00a0You can get them already mixed in a base cream or, buy the active ingredient and then mix it fresh in your favorite moisturizer.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Moisturizer made for my skin type. \u00a0It's best that once per year you see a Dermatologist to maintain your skin type and any changes to get the best results.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>*Sunscreen. \u00a0I use EltaMD because it's amazing and not greasy. \u00a0It also feels like it has a primer in it, so my makeup looks great!

\ud83d\ude0a<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs I was flipping through my Sirius radio channels while driving, I heard a voice say:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>\"Your fifty-eight years old. \u00a0Stay in your marriage. \u00a0At your age, you won't be able to find anyone else and being alone is far worse at your age then the pain of staying in your marriage.\"<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\nOf course, I thought this was both ridiculous and intriguing at the same time so I stayed tuned to the station, and it was the famous Dr. Laura talking to a woman that called in about her husband having multiple affairs and her question was <strong><em>\"Should I leave him or stay?\"<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\nTo be fair to Dr. Laura, she was probably telling the lady what she wanted to hear because she had a vibe of being afraid to take the next step and leave.\r\n\r\nDr. Laura explained that the fact that she had grown kids and that her husband would probably get remarried to a younger girl and then all of the families including her, most likely she'd be alone, would have to gather at family functions, and, this would be painful. \u00a0Maybe more painful than getting a divorce.\r\n\r\nThe lady was a bit taken back, but ultimately she agreed because I guess she needed affirmation in her decision to stay.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to that conversation, I turned the station to Spa music which helps me to relax and keep my mind at peace. \u00a0But, not today. \u00a0I was bothered by the radio conversation because I wonder if all of us women of a certain age have to worry about whether or not our options will change. \u00a0And according to Dr. Laura and society, it's not an if, it's a certainty that they will.\r\n\r\nMaybe I have my fears because my mothers biggest fear was that she was going to die alone. \u00a0I always say that we create what we fear. \u00a0After several failed marriages, she did, in fact, die alone.\r\n\r\nHowever, dying alone is not my biggest fear. \u00a0I fear that I will get old and my husband will leave me for a thirty-year-old, and I will have no relevance. <em>\u00a0I know, dumb things that we sometimes tell ourselves :(<\/em>\r\n\r\nJust so you know, I don't sit around worrying about this, but it does make one a little off when at a certain age, we walk into a room, and it's like we have disappeared into a crowd. Or, like last night, I stood at the bar trying to get a glass of wine, and they looked right passed me.\r\n<h3>Maybe my real fear is getting old?<\/h3>\r\nLater that day, I met my daughter for dinner, and I explained the radio conversation, and she just rolled her eyes and said, \"Mom that's not how it is.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I would like to believe\u00a0her, I also had to set her straight and explain that this is, in fact,\u00a0is the way that it is. \u00a0Men can date half their age and women can barely get a date after fifty or sixty let alone beyond.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to a time when my husband and I were eating dinner, and I pointed to a few beautiful women, and I said:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>\"If we ever got a divorce, one of those women would be your next wife.\" \u00a0He quickly replied with \"I'm not going to date women our age if we got a divorce.\" <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0I was mortified because for one, I needed him to at least lie to me and say <em><strong>\"Yeah\"<\/strong><\/em> and two, I didn't need confirmation on what I already feared.<\/p>\r\nA friend of mine said she was playfully joking with her husband and she said:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>\"Okay if you get a girlfriend then I'll go find a guy too.\" <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>\u00a0He replied \"Oh yeah? \u00a0Well, I have more value than you at your age. \u00a0The joke went from funny to not so funny, super quick!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\nI was listening to Kathleen Turners interview yesterday with Vulture Magazine, and she said that she once got a script\u00a0and when she read it, it said, that she was going to be thirty-seven years old and \"<strong>STILL SOMEWHAT ATTRACTIVE!\" \u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nGeeze, if we are only somewhat attractive at thirty-seven because that's when we're old, how are women over fifty supposed to feel? \u00a0I am not implying that we have to be what others think as beautiful but, we have to feel good in our skin.\r\n\r\nI know too that it's not about how we look, it's about the connections in life that we make. \u00a0It's not about things it's about living the beautiful life that we are given. \u00a0I know that life is short and if God forbid I am diagnosed with a terminal illness, none of this crap that I'm writing about even matters!\r\n\r\nSo I am not going to insert the word <em><strong>but <\/strong><\/em>here because writing the above paragraph just put it all in perspective, whereas when I run it through my mind, it wasn't so clear.\r\n\r\nLife is not about fearing and worrying that someone that is supposed to love you and be faithful to you is going to trade you in for a newer model. \u00a0It's about trusting and loving that person with all that you have. \u00a0We can't fully love if we are in fear of loss.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, we are all going to be alone one day. \u00a0Whether it's through death, divorce, or whatever. \u00a0Life has a beginning, a middle and an end.\r\n\r\nNo matter what, it's important to live all three of these parts because while I was worried about stupid shit like getting old and younger women, the sun is starting to set in the third part of my life and there's no time to waste :)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium

With Yourself<\/span> \ud83d\ude18<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese days we have so many gadgets, apps., online conveniences, and so much more but still, it feels like we never have enough time for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I do have some free time, I find myself looking for something to do rather than connecting with myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger, I would do all kinds of soul searching and reading and, whatever felt good for my spirit. \u00a0Now, I find that I \u00a0rarely connect with myself anymore.\r\n\r\nSo, I started a list (on my smartphone of course) on the ways that I have started connecting with myself again.\r\n\r\nThe following is my list:\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">10 Ways to Reconnect With Yourself<\/span> \ud83d\ude18<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Do one of the following or more!!<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8308\"

yourself\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Take fifteen minutes per day no matter what to reconnect.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Sit next to a window and just stare and daydream.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Take a walk. \u00a0When is the last time that you took a walk by yourself?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Get on the floor and stretch every part of your body.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Meditate. \u00a0It was hard for me to meditate because I am an anxious person by nature, however, using my smartphone, I downloaded an app. with meditation music. \u00a0\u00a0I close my eyes and try to stay in the moment. \u00a0I go through a list of forgiveness and gratitude and before I know it, fifteen minutes is up, and I feel great! \u00a0It takes a few times, but the music helps.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Sit in a sauna or Jacuzzi and just relax. \u00a0I use an infrared sauna, and I sit in it for thirty minutes per day. \u00a0I swear it clears my mind.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Okay, I'm about to go deep here \ud83d\ude2c\u00a0 Comfortably lay down or sit and think back as far as you can remember to when you were a child. \u00a0Then, watch yourself grow up. \u00a0Go through every year of your life until now. \u00a0If you can do it, it's amazing. \u00a0If you're like me and you have some forgiving yourself to do, it is very healing and closes a lot of doors.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>If you're lucky enough to have a parent or both, spend time with them weekly. \u00a0It's one of the biggest connections with yourself that you'll miss when they're gone.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Do something that you love. \u00a0I love to cook and I really get into the groove. It relaxes me. \u00a0Maybe you like to crochet or paint? \u00a0Fifteen minutes a day will create some beautiful things in no time. \u00a0Remember though, no agenda.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Don't wait until the kids are grown, the debt is paid off, you retire, or anything else. \u00a0Do what you want now because today is a gift and tomorrow is not promised. \u00a0I'm sure that I don't have to remind you about how life goes so fast.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNotice that I didn't say exercise on the list. \u00a0I think that doing anything that has a goal defeats the purpose of connecting with yourself as there is an agenda.\r\n\r\nThe ten recommendations above are so that your mind and your soul can merge together without a whole lot of effort.\r\n\r\nIt's like resting the mind so our soul feels regenerated.\r\n\r\nThat was my list. \u00a0I would love to see yours. \ud83d\ude00\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate. \u00a0I have created a six-step course called \"The Rejuvenation Program\" \u00a0You can check it out by clicking this link:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com<\/span><\/a><\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/> The Rejuvenation Program","videolink":"k-eBMAdkDCk","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">10 ways to reconnect with yourself<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">healing<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">How to connect with yourself<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to eat better<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">How to get better skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to remove toxins from your life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">love<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">meditation<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">soul searching<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the rejuvenation program<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">yoga<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/63903917_s-624x719.jpg"},{"id":959,"slug":"your-vagina-after","type":"post","title":"Your Vagina after 50 \ud83d\ude44","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Your Vagina after 50 \ud83d\ude44<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI didn't know if I should write this post because I have a few people in my family that don't want to know about my vaginal health!\r\n\r\nWith that said, they probably don't read this blog so I'm going to take a chance here and hopefully my son, God bless him if he reads this because for one, when I ask him to fold the clothes in the dryer he takes a pencil and picks up my underwear and carries it to my room \ud83d\ude44\u00a0and then two, he would totally plug his ears and say \"la la, la la\" when any subject about his mothers body comes up!\r\n\r\nOkay, back to my original reason that I am writing this post is that I've had a bit of irritating last couple of months!\r\n\r\nOne day I'm frolicking in jeans and then bam! I'm unable to wear jeans or anything that touches anything (get where I'm going here?)\r\n\r\nWithout going into full detail (no diseases or anything like that) just a complete change in my bodies bullshit capacity to change as I age.\r\n\r\nHow do I know it's a problem with changing as I age? Well because, when I went to my OBGYN, which I seem to have done more in the last year than in my entire lifetime, she says \"oh, when you get older the balance of your vagina changes.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI'm like \"Woman, what does that mean?\" \u00a0I don't want my vaginas balance to change! \u00a0I'm trying to stay young, look good and age well. \u00a0The last thing that I need is an unbalanced vagina!\r\n\r\nSo, I tell her to let's get it back into balance. \u00a0Afterall, I have a sex hungry husband that balanced or not; I have duties to adhere to. \u00a0I don't have the leisure in my marriage to wait out or balance out my vagina issues!\r\n\r\nI mean really, do younger girls have vagina issues? I don't hear of them. \u00a0Okay, no one talks about them no matter what our age but still, WTF!\r\n\r\nDoes a vagina do what the hell it wants? \u00a0It must because it's not cooperating with me and I'm sitting here in a sexy black dress with no underwear (which I hate) waiting for my husband to go to dinner.\r\n\r\nWhy no underwear... No, it's not because after 30 years of marriage I'm going to play some sexy game at dinner (guess what honey? I'm not wearing panties, hell no! I can't keep up as it is) but, it's more like. \"God I hope he doesn't notice that I'm not wearing panties so I can rest.\" Because mostly, I can't wear them now!!!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Here is what happens to our Vagina as we age<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8286\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/97155316_s-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Vaginal Health\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/> Your Vaginal Health Over 50\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI'm not going to talk about the aesthetics\u00a0because that's a whole other story.\r\n\r\nAs we age we lose the sex hormone, Estrogen. \u00a0Which causes dramatic changes is the appearance and the function of our vagina.\r\n\r\nThe length and size shrink\u00a0and then we lose our lubrication. \u00a0Which then, the vaginal area becomes irritated and with that, the walls become thin and we lose elasticity. \u00a0This can inhibit our sex drives and relationships.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Thankfully there are things that we can do to keep or Vaginas healthy and young!<\/span><\/h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Six Ways To Take Care of Your Vagina After 50!<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>\u00a0Moisturize using moisturizers like Replens and Luvena to eliminate dryness.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\u00a0Seems a bit different but you can use a good organic coconut oil too. \u00a0Just make sure you're not allergic to it and do a spot test on your forearm before using on your vagina.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Use a low dose of Estrogen Therapy via a pill, cream, or a vaginal ring. \u00a0Just talk to your doctor. \u00a0You can do this two or three times a week. \u00a0If you don't want a pill, the cream is inserted at night and works amazingly.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Your partner will love this one. \u00a0Stay sexually active as the vagina will go into atrophy if you don't. \u00a0You know what they say \"Use it or lose it.\" \u00a0Sex helps the vagina maintain moisture and flexibility.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Do Kegel exercises! \u00a0I do one hundred per day and if you want to avoid having to wear leak guard protection in your later years, this really helps. \u00a0Kegel's help with avoiding\u00a0<strong>prolapse. \u00a0<\/strong>This happens when organs starting slipping out of place \ud83d\ude33<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Take a probiotic. \u00a0This really helps keep the good flora active as we age to avoid things like yeast infections, etc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nDoing the steps above are super easy and not time-consuming. \u00a0Both your vagina and your partner will thank you for it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>\u00a0If you want to do something really great for yourself, I created a six-step course called \"The Rejuvenation Program\" \u00a0You can check it out by clicking this link:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com<\/span><\/a><\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/> The Rejuvenation Program\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"border-top-left-radius: 2px;

about 60 to 70 percent of what you put on your skin is absorbed into your body.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\u201cFalse; Most of what we put on our skin is absorbed much too slowly, if at all, for that to happen. If the skin this much pass into our bodies, many of the chemicals that occur naturally in our bodies and keep us alive would escape through our skin, too, and that isn't happening. source:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.annmariegianni.com\/much-skin-actually-absorb\/\"> https:\/\/www.annmariegianni.com\/much-skin-actually-absorb\/<\/a><\/em><\/strong>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">How Toxins Enter Our Body and the Chemical Burden<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe skin\u2019s function is to be a barrier. It's there to keep our organs, etc. from harmful elements. Like, bacteria, radiation, the sun and other things from hurting us.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s divided into three parts. I won\u2019t go all in with regards to the whole anatomy of its structure; however, I will give just the basics here.\r\n\r\nWe have three parts. The Epidermis, dermis and the hypodermis.\r\nMany substances are too big to be absorbed by our skin, however, contrary to what the FDA might say, absorption of chemicals is very real.\r\n\r\nJust look at medication we are given through things like medical patches, hormones creams, pain creams, fentanyl patches. Even sunscreens have warning labels on them.\r\n\r\nAlso, the skin on our scalp and face have more absorption that the rest of our body.\r\n\r\nTemperature, skin integrity, the concentration of the product, length of time exposed, etc. all are factors in the fact of whether our skin absorbs products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Pathways of absorption<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne of the things that concern me is how many products that I put on my face that I get in my mouth on a daily basis like, serums, sunscreens, makeup, lipstick and so many others.\r\n\r\nDid I mention all the things that we breathe in too? Like, environmental toxins, house sprays, cleaning solutions, perfume, oil burners, candles, etc.\r\n\r\nNot to mention when I take baths and showers how products get absorbed in the female area. It sounds crazy but those of us who have had bladder infections and suffered significantly know that, we don\u2019t dare use bubble bath or fragrances while taking a bath.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nOur skin absorbs toxins no matter what they say. The question here is how much?

You\u2019re getting close to sixty.\r\n\r\nI never thought I would be sixty and with God willing, I will make it there.\u00a0 I know there are many who have never had the chance.\r\n\r\nI am so grateful to be alive and thankful. \u00a0 Each day my appreciation and my gratitude for life expand, and I am humbled in a way I\u00a0 that I never thought possible.\r\n\r\nI feel that I am in a good place in my life.\u00a0 Where I used to have regret for the things that I have done and the mistakes that I have made, I feel now that there is no time for regret only time for forgiveness and moving forward.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I am learning is to live with is the loss of my mother and my brother.\u00a0 They died on the same day exactly two years apart.\u00a0 I miss them both.\u00a0 It took me over a year to accept that they nor I will live forever.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful that my mother often visits me in my dreams.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s one of the great things about being younger (besides being skinny and not having to work out), you never think that you or anyone you love is going to die.\u00a0 I guess it crosses your mind, but you never get it until someone dies.\r\n\r\nI hope that my mother and my brother are in a beautiful place.\u00a0 They were both in terrible spiritual pain that they tried to alleviate the pain through means of physical relief that ended their lives.\u00a0 It is my prayer that they are together and out of misery.\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">My how life has flown by<\/span><\/h2>\r\nI guess the point of this post was going to be about how fast life has flown by and all of the ways that it has, however, now, my heart is guiding me in a new direction of not focusing on what was but instead on what is.\r\n\r\nSure my adult kids will never be my babies anymore.\u00a0 I will retire, the calendar will move faster and faster and, my time will be over too.\u00a0 Just like everyone else.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, life is about living.\u00a0 Live is half chance for me and everyone else.\u00a0 If you\u2019re lucky, you got most of it right but, if you\u2019re human you a lot of it wrong.\u00a0 I\u2019m at the time where I can now make it right.\r\n\r\nAt this point in life, I want to give more than I receive.\u00a0 Put back more than I take.\u00a0 I want to step back and let others shine.\u00a0 I no longer need the spotlight and wish I knew then what I know now because I would have never needed it then.\r\n\r\nI have the life that I want because my mother taught me what not to do.\u00a0 I created the complete opposite and have everything that she did not.\u00a0 I have good kids, a loving spouse, materials and mostly, piece of mind and serenity. \u00a0 These are the things that eluded my mother for her entire life.\r\n\r\nSo my point (yet again, I know) is that the meaning in life is whether you will make it the best life that you can so that you can lift others up so that, they can do the same.\u00a0 I believe this changes the world and this is our legacy.\r\n\r\nSo to take it down the line, my daughter got her masters in School Psychology.\u00a0 She specializes in helping autistic, and special needs children get noticed so that they won\u2019t become a statistic.\r\n\r\nI guess God wanted my mom to be here so that she could have me, so I could break the cycle so that, I could have my daughter so that, she can change the world.\r\n\r\nMy work is done :) I\u2019m ready to get old now.\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like

happy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class=\"p4\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">How to get more youthful skin\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Basic cosmetic procedures that are the least expensive and would be a natural progression after skin care. Compared to products, cosmetic procedures are not a commodity so finding bargain cosmetic procedures may not be a good thing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We\u2019re talking about wounding the skin, and this doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with cheaper. However, there is no reason you can\u2019t call around to your local dermatologists or plastic surgeons to find out what procedures cost.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Then you can compare for yourself. I pick three or four good doctors or medical spas in my area and check their prices, and then I get on their email list. Before long, I get discounted offers of up to thirty percent off their procedures.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s worth it to compare and get on their lists. You\u2019ll get weekly emails from all the places you signed up at to compare the prices. You can even call your favorite doctor or spa and ask if they will match prices. They do it all the time!<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong><i>Botox<\/i><\/strong> \u2013 You should get Botox as a prevention measure. You may only need twenty units or so just to prevent frown lines or lines that may be forming between your nose and eyes called the elevens.<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can also have Botox used on your crow\u2019s feet (the lines around your eyes). This helps tremendously. If you need thirty or forty units and you can\u2019t afford it all at once, then get ten units every few weeks until you get all areas covered.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost varies, but I have paid up to fourteen-dollars a unit. When I got on the doctors\u2019 or Spa lists, I received discounts, and now I only pay about nine to ten dollars per unit. That\u2019s a pretty good savings. Some doctors will have a buy two get one free promotion.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, there are competing products to Botox. Because they\u2019re competing with Botox, they may be less money. Botox, which is owned by Allergen, has a loyalty program, as well. I recently received a coupon for $100 off the total cost of my Botox!<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This program is called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brilliantdistinctionsprogram.com\/\">BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS<\/a>. Make sure you sign up or have your doctor\/injector sign you up and every time you get Botox or another Allergan product such as Juvederm, etc. you will receive points towards your next service.<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I almost got my most recent Botox for free by doing this.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Chemical Peel<\/i> \u2013 A chemical peel is great for removing the surface layer of the skin. The process wounds the skin, which causes it to heal itself by creating new collagen. A chemical peel has different strengths so the cost will vary. \u00a0You can do it at home. \u00a0Check out my course <a href=\"https:\/\/how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\">(https:\/\/how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com)<\/a><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In most states, a chemical peel will cost about $150 to \u00a0$200 in a doctor\u2019s office. You\u2019ll want to continue having peels, as they will help create beautiful skin with less texture and, diminish fine lines.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can do them yourself, but start with a low strength. \u00a0Unfortunately, in my learning process, I bought a fifty-percent TCA peel online (I should not have been able to purchase this strength peel without a license), and I did some serious damage to my skin. Damage so bad that, I have to hide the scars every day for three years. It\u2019s not the worth the risk to try and skip ahead rather than to start slow or let a professional do it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to do your peel, start with a small patch of skin to see how it will react. I do my own peels every two to four weeks, usually no more than twice a month. You can go to <i>skin-peel.com<\/i> to find them.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The secret to making peels comfortable is while they are on your face, use your blow dryer on the cool setting or, use a small hand fan pointed at your face. It makes a difference.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Retin-A<\/i> \u2013 A prescription is required, but Retin-A is fantastic!! \u201cRetin-A (tretinoin) is a topical preparation of vitamin A, which has antioxidant properties, just like the vitamin by itself. It\u2019s an acid derivative of retinol (vitamin A).<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The important aspect is the effectiveness of what Retin-A does. Studies have shown that Retin-A can help reduce wrinkles, reduce acne, exfoliate dead skin cells and redistribute melanin. Melanin redistribution results in lighter, more even skin color. Thus Retin-A is often used to treat skin discolorations caused by excessive sun exposure.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have sensitive skin, it may not work for you, it may be too harsh, but there are alternatives with lesser concentrations. \u00a0I would still try to mix a little every other night with my favorite cream. Just don\u2019t give up. This stuff is amazing! \u00a0I heard it said that anyone with a pulse and a credit card should use Retin-A.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Get Retin-A for less at GOODRX.COM<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Teeth Whitening<\/i> \u2013 This makes a huge difference. You could have perfect skin and straight teeth, but if your teeth are stained and dull, no one will notice anything else. If you have bright, white teeth, you\u2019ll look better, and younger, and feel better too. \u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost in my state is about $100.00, which is down from $500 when I first had it done. There are many good ones over the counter too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">IPL-, which stands for intense pulse light or flash lamp therapy, is a noninvasive and non-ablative treatment that uses high intensity pulses of visible light to improve the appearance of birthmarks, port wine stains, broken facial veins, rosy cheeks, rosacea, red thread veins of the legs, freckles, age spots, facial lines and wrinkles, and the removal of unwanted dark hair. The procedure is referred to as photo rejuvenation and requires a series of treatments. \u00a0I can tell you personally that it doesn't work on legs :(<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost nationally runs about $100 to $300. You should only need a few treatments. I have seen it as low as $80 per treatment if you agree to three or more.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0It\u2019s important to know that brown spots on the body are hard to remove. \u00a0I add a skin bleach and put a little of my skin peel on each spot\u00a0when I do peels on my face. \u00a0It takes a long time and staying out of the sun maintain my treatment.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Dermapen or Micro-Needling \u2013 \u201c Sterile surgical stainless micro-needles pierce the skin leading to apoptosis of cells in the dermis.\u201d \u201cWhat is Apoptosis? Apoptosis or programmed cell death is when a cell essentially commits suicide. This process is natural, controlled and routine. Little inflammation is caused.\u201d \u201cThe Dermapen uses eleven, 33-gauge micro needles to stimulate the dermis. Needles vertically pierce the skin to enhance rejuvenation results. Small holes are punctured at a rate of 1000\/second.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s2\">This proliferation of the body\u2019s tissue continues to release growth factors from fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and monocytes.\u201d<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Note: I have had <i>Dermapen<\/i> about six times and it works wonders. It\u2019s comparable to lasers like Fraxel but without all the downtime and expense. Many doctors will give you a discount if you buy a package of four or more. You can save hundreds by doing this. I paid $150 per treatment vs. $300 \u2013 $350 by buying the package.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Juvederm<\/i> \u2013 Juvederm is an injectable filler consisting mostly of hyaluronic acid. It\u2019s used to fill in areas to smooth out wrinkles and deep folds on the face and can last up to a year. You can pay anywhere from $400 a syringe to $800. I pay only about $500 \u2013 $550 depending on the specials the doctors have. Currently, my doctor has\u00a0a buy one get one half off, and I can save the second one for a later time. At first, you may need two but, as your stem cells work, you will need less later. \u00a0In my case, it lasts about six months. \u00a0Remember, you get points for this with the Brilliant Distinctions Program.<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">These are certainly not all of the basic cosmetic procedures available, but these tend to be the least expensive and the least invasive. These procedures do well concerning anti-aging and reversing past damage.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">They\u2019re also a good alternative to going under the knife. I think one day these products and procedures will be affordable for all of us<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">With today\u2019s technology, the need for doctors to perform invasive procedures will diminish so they\u2019ll be more eager to lower procedure costs to attract more patients.

Some may call this depression, but for me, it wasn\u2019t.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>And, it wasn\u2019t that there was always something greater and better that I was chasing either.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I know about watering my own grass.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">I wasn\u2019t looking to escape myself and I certainly never wanted to be anyone but me.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Sure I could be prettier, smarter and have nicer stuff but really, does any of that make someone happy for very long?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pretty fades, smarter becomes irrelevant, and you can\u2019t take stuff with you.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">But, I always had this little hole that I couldn\u2019t fill.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I got some therapy; I had my share of boyfriends to fill it and, I\u2019ve spent my way through pretty good sums of money only to end up right back to where I had always been.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Back to me the person with the hole.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">So when I turned fifty life clicked for me.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I finally got it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I was happy all along but, I was creating my unhappiness by the disappointment that I created about, all of the ways that I thought life should be.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">The truth is, life is half chance and half results.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Blame it on the media, magazines, reality shows, parents or whatever but, <strong>how to be happy<\/strong> comes back to whether we are comfortable in our skin, at any stage in life. Some are luckier than others and get this sooner than I did at fifty but, never the less, I got it before it was too late.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Better late than never.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">That was it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I was never comfortable in my skin.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I figured at age fifty; if I wasn\u2019t comfortable by now, I\u2019d better figure out how to get that way or figure out an exit plan because I certainly wasn\u2019t going to allow myself to grow old and bitter.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, I didn\u2019t want to walk around thinking a part of me was missing for the next half of my life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">It doesn\u2019t matter what age you are, how to be happy is about being comfortable in your skin.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It\u2019s not about comparing yourself to anything other than the person that you were yesterday.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Not tomorrow because, you don\u2019t have that day yet and, you may never get it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Another thing that has changed me is the acceptance that life is beautiful and, it\u2019s quick and, those that we love are here one day and gone the next.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Like both my mother and my brother.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Let me say that when you forget that your mom has passed away but, you pick up the phone to call her and then you realize that she is no longer there, not today, not tomorrow, not ever again, life becomes pretty sobering.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are fortunate to have not lost a parent, please, call them every day because, when you do,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>you\u2019ll feel a kind of pain the hurts beyond what you thought was even possible (sorry.

This is what most people will remember you for.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Not stuff, not your looks, not how much money you had.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This is your true legacy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">I know that really bad things happen in life and, these things will pass.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We will all die and so will the people we love.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We will have financial difficulties, and life will sometimes punch us so hard that it knocks the wind out and sometimes for longer than we had planned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>But, life goes on with or without us, and that\u2019s just how it is.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This is the acceptance part that we must do.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m not here to give you a cheesy line about how grateful you should be. \u00a0 Or that what you have others would probably kill to have. \u00a0I will say that you and I should take some time every day to realize how short life is and understand that, we don\u2019t have a lot of time other than to live our lives to the fullest while we are here for the short time that we have.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p12\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">There is no magic to being happy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The secret is to accept the beautiful life that God has given, don\u2019t over think, add a little gratitude and, keep smiling knowing that you have this day which may be your last.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1 class=\"p15\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Change is coming<\/span><\/h1>\r\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #33cccc;\">READY FOR A CHANGE?<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7494\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/18153601_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"406\" height=\"284\" \/> Time for a change. Live like you mean it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Change is a natural part of life and to resist it is futile. Changes occur all around us, and there is nothing we can do about it. Sometimes change is good and sometimes, as we feel a change, it may be uncomfortable, so we resist it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Even after all the resisting we do, there comes a time when we are ready for a change. When we accept it, we listen to our inner self, possibly the one that has been talking to us our whole lives, but only now are we listening.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s the voice that we have always wanted to hear but didn\u2019t take its advice until now. It\u2019s time for a change and with change comes healing and transformation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The key to making a change is wanting to do it. Even if we fail on our journey, the more we keep trying, the higher the chance is that we will succeed. I don\u2019t need a diet to deprive myself. As soon as I say diet, I get a negative emotion that pulls me in the opposite direction, and I automatically go right back to the way I was or sometimes worse.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes instead of feeling good, I feel bad, and this is what I focus on. I realize that I don\u2019t need to live like this regularly. The fact is, I don\u2019t need to diet; I need to eat better. We as a society put so many restrictions on ourselves and when we don\u2019t succeed we punish ourselves, and the cycle continues.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I need to make a lifestyle change, that\u2019s all. If you want to make a difference, make a change, but don\u2019t do it because of others. You know what will and will not make you a better person. This is the only change we need to make.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There is no one solution for change. Everyone is different, and it is through trial and error that we succeed. I tend to go in circles when I don\u2019t know how to make a change. This wastes so much time that I often stop trying and start again later, only to go in circles again.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Once I fall, I know why I fell, and I don\u2019t fall that way again.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0No sense in kicking ourselves when we are down. It doesn\u2019t make sense to be defeated before we start. I have wasted a lot of time in my life, not by trying and failing, nope, I have lost more time not doing anything at all.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are sitting on the fence or the couch for that matter and you know it\u2019s time for a change, what are you waiting for?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Momentum kicks in in any situation when we get started. Think about when you were in school, and you had a term paper due. You may have been the kid who waited until the last minute because you didn\u2019t have a topic and you didn\u2019t know where to begin. Painfully, you waited until the last minute and got started the night before or the morning that it was due.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not so much that time isn\u2019t on your side, its momentum that kicks in and you get on a roll. Once you are in this phase, you are blowing and going, and you see the end in sight. It\u2019s just like change. You realize that it\u2019s not so hard and wonder why you didn\u2019t do it sooner. We make things harder than they need to be.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>Elements of change:<\/strong><\/span><\/em><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Readiness, barriers, and relapse should all be expected on the road to change. We only make a change when we are ready to. I want my mom to stop smoking and take care of herself, but she is not ready to and at seventy-one, she probably never will be. (She passed away last year).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I can\u2019t do anything about it, only accept it, and she has to own it and pay the consequences. I spent a lot of years trying to get her and others to change for the better, and I was always met with resistance. It wasn\u2019t until I came to terms with the truth that no one will ever change unless they want to, not because I wanted them to.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Why I needed someone to be other than who they wanted to be, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s obvious when health is an issue; you want your loved ones to be around; however, if this is not what they want, it\u2019s no longer a problem for me. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">When I stopped preaching to my mother, our relationship got much better. She was happy with who she was, and if this is what she chose for her time on this earth, then it is what it is.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">By the way getting older is also about death and losing the ones that you love.\u00a0 I took my momma back home to San Diego and gave her a burial at sea.\u00a0 It was beautiful.\u00a0 If want, you can check out the three-minute video here.\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qiqQrwy5crg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qiqQrwy5crg<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Barriers to change are other obstacles to overcome when we want to change. What is preventing us from changing? I will go back to my mother\u2019s story (last time I promise). Why wouldn\u2019t she want to stop smoking and get healthy so she can live longer and have a better quality of health? <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I would surmise that she didn't want to make the change because, in her mind, it would have been more painful to live without cigarettes than it is to live with them.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s important to know that change happens gradually. There will be a relapse, and there may be discomfort. Very few of us are so strong-willed that we won\u2019t ever have a relapse.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There will always be factors begging for our attention. Change means being proactive and, if you are, eventually, change will be a commitment you have to yourself.\u00a0 Also, know that you may resist what you must do but, you must do what you resist.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">A New Way to age<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7389\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/31388215_s-400x237-300x178.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"209\" \/> A new way to age and live longer\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Renewing yourself is your body\u2019s master plan for rejuvenation.\u00a0 <i>This consists of three important steps; protect, repair and rejuvenate.<\/i>\u00a0 Our body\u2019s renewal system prevents disease by protecting the cells and then repairing the damaged ones.\u00a0 We have been given a specific healing system, and its mission is to achieve maximum health.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Why do we need an elaborate healing system to renew ourselves?\u00a0 The damage that we do to ourselves and for what our environment does to us threatens our entire existence.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Renewal is a constant process in our body.\u00a0 Just trying to repair the everyday wear and tear is bad enough but then, the renewal process must kick it up a notch should we get sick or injured.\u00a0 \u00a0When we have an acute or chronic condition, our body kicks into overdrive to repair the damage.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">A good example of how the body can renew itself better is, if you break a bone, or cut yourself or, sustain an injury of some kind.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t have your renewal system revved up, then it may take you a bit of time to heal, and it may not be entirely as we age.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">However, if your cells are in renewal mode, then you will heal much faster.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to extend our lifespan, we must halt cellular damage and increase our healing system.\u00a0 To do this, we come back to, protecting, repairing and regenerating our cells.\u00a0 Each one of these should function to its optimal level, and if they don\u2019t then, the entire system will fail.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We already know the key to cell renewal is antioxidants because our cells are under constant attack from free radicals.\u00a0 The damage free radicals do to cells shortens our life which means that we die before we need to due to cellular injury.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA typical cell is hit by approximately twenty billion free radicals per day.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 So long as we have enough free radicals in our body, we can fight this.\u00a0 Think about it, twenty billion free radicals hit just one cell! And, we have so many cells.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you get down to it, why wouldn\u2019t we help our body fight against this mass attack by consuming antioxidants and avoiding the things that cause free radicals in the first place?\u00a0 See when we let our antioxidants fall below optimal then free radicals have the upper hand.\u00a0 After a billion hits here and there, now you have severe cellular damage.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This type of damage not only causes disease but it\u2019s the quickest way to aging.\u00a0 Again, how to counter this is to take in generous amounts of antioxidant foods and supplements.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>If you would like, I have a \"7 Day Rejuvenation Program\" that you can download right here:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8213\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-04-08-at-2.54.05-PM-300x216.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" \/> How to rejuvenate your body in seven days without being rigid\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Don't worry.

Relationships at middle age\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ah yes, the love lives of women. \u00a0I can\u2019t tell you how many times I hear women say, \u201cThere are just no good ones left,\u201d or worse, \u201cI don\u2019t want a man.\u201d Is this true? Even when in a relationship, married or not, we can get bored.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m not saying we need a man to be happy; I wonder if some women quietly settle for not having one. I realize that at middle age, there doesn\u2019t appear to be many single and qualified men out there and that the men we are married to have grown to be a bit unexciting and predictable.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I also realize the dating world is a different world out there.\u00a0I hear stories from women who say men don\u2019t want to commit or are disrespectful. I hear about men having multiple girlfriends and lying to them about seeing other people.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I listen to others say how lonely they are and have settled for mediocre instead of holding out for the right guy. I may not understand, but I feel for those who would like to have a partner, someone to love and to love them, but it\u2019s just not happening. I feel for those who have given up, never expecting to find love at all.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Even those of us who are married, life isn\u2019t always perfect. We go through times of doubt, and question whether we want to be married, too. I think one thing is constant and that is that, the older we get, the more settled we are with ourselves. Therefore, we may be or are okay with not having a partner, and we learn to create our happiness and, more importantly, we own it, and it feels good.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Today, I took lunch to a past neighbor who is elderly and just out of the hospital after hip replacement surgery. She lives alone, has basically no family, lost her job due to age discrimination, and it is highly unlikely she will ever find another job at her age.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">She has no money except Social Security and spends a dollar a day at the Dollar General store for soup to survive. I asked her if she wished she was married and how it felt being alone. I asked if she was afraid. She told me she would never want to be married for the sake of being married, and if she didn\u2019t have\u00a0passion for a man, then she wouldn\u2019t want to just exist in a relationship like a lot of people do.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\">She also said she was very happy at this point in her life, and then genuinely laughed as though she was. The teacher has, yet again, appeared through her by showing me that, for all she doesn\u2019t have, she is still authentically happy, while I wake up each day looking for what could be better in my life.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">This teacher has taught me to appreciate what I have and to stop looking for more and better. I already have it all, and there is nothing more or better that I need.<strong> That\u2019s the secret: if you don\u2019t need it, there is nothing missing.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><i>BE YOUR BEST AT ANY AGE<\/i><\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7460\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/39808977_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"303\" \/> Your best at any age\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>\u00a0<\/i><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Who knows what the fountain of youth is? We all know that aging catches up with us very quickly. They say, the older you get, the faster you get old. It\u2019s as though we wake up one day and the years have passed us by!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019re rocking along in your life looking and feeling great and then suddenly, out of nowhere, reality hits you; you can\u2019t do the same things or look the same as you did. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Contrary to what we have been told, there is things we can do to slow down the aging process and keep ourselves on top of our game, and to, as they say, \u201cage gracefully.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As far as I am concerned, beauty companies are liars! And we all know they are not anti-aging us, but putting moisture on top of our skin and taking our money. Like the Oil of Olay, commercial says, \u201cDo you still have wrinkles even after the wrinkle cream is gone?\u201d The fact of the matter is, we are going to go through many changes in our mind, body, and appearance.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Unless you have a fortune to spend on plastic surgery (even that doesn\u2019t look good after a while), you will be like the rest of us women. Your skin will age, and your body fat will shift to places you would never have imagined and you will slow down.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Is it fair? No. Can we do much about it, very little? The sooner we accept that we will age no matter what, the sooner we can move along and find peace and look our best at any age for the age we are at the time. At this point in life, we are on the last third of our lives.\u00a0 Living life to the fullest is all you should do now.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">If I could tell you one thing that will anti-age you, and it doesn\u2019t cost you a dime, and it\u2019s probably the closest to the fountain of youth you will ever know, would you want to know about it?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Of course, you do<\/i>, so here it is!!!\u00a0 It's called <strong>EXERCISE<\/strong>! That\u2019s it! Exercise at least five days a week. You will keep your weight down and your butt where it is, and even improve upon it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It will keep the blood pumped to your skin giving you a natural glow. People lose thirty percent of their muscle strength between the ages of fifty and seventy, and then lose another thirty percent for each decade after that.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Alarming, if you think about it because we need good muscle tone. We need to work out for balance and mobility as we get older. \u00a0It will be even more important to maintain muscle tone as we become elderly.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The reason staying active is more important than ever is it keeps us coordinated, so we don\u2019t fall and break a hip, and it keeps the neurons in our brains firing. We need to keep our brains active to avoid dementia and to remember things like names of people, which I am very bad at. You don\u2019t have to hit the gym and run ten miles or take a cardio spinning class until you pass out either.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m simply talking about walking, riding a bike, swimming, or taking a dance class, and lift weights to keep your muscle tone and bones strong. Whatever you do, you must also wear sunscreen every day, as the sun is the number one reason we get wrinkles!\u00a0 Just saying :)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For me, I work out, and I take in one gram of protein for every pound I weigh, and I also take supplements daily. Although I do have my bad habits, like drinking wine daily, I justify this by taking exceptionally good care of myself the rest of the time, as in eating organic, very little carbs and drinking a ton of water.\u00a0 I not about being rigid either.\u00a0 I would rather enjoy the time I have left and simply balance it out.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t forget to go to the doctor yearly, and get your mammogram.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> Our cells are programmed genetically to die at a certain point and there is nothing we can do about that. However, don\u2019t underestimate \"environment versus biology.\"<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">We are in more control of our outcome then we give ourselves credit for. The goal may not be to live forever but to forever live a quality life while we are here.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2 class=\"p19\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">LETTING GO OF EMOTIONAL PAIN<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7440\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/40438945_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"273\" \/> Letting go of emotional pain\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes our hearts are weak, and our spirits are broken, but, still, we get up and go about the day and push down the pain. Maybe we were born with spiritual pain, or we have unresolved issues that we haven\u2019t let go of, and we hold them inside not knowing how to let go. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Some believe in past lives and that we are born with pain and this pain is a punishment from a past life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who are Christian, they don\u2019t believe this, but believe that we can remove the pain by giving it to God. Give it to something or someone and let it go if you have it. It\u2019s not worth holding on to. Without being mindful, we hold on to pain so tight that it leaves us exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0I am not saying things didn\u2019t happen to you in your past. Maybe you can\u2019t even remember or pinpoint anything. I couldn\u2019t imagine some of the circumstances people have gone through and are still able to live each day.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I have had hardships, but I am blessed that my pain is not as deep as others.\u00a0 All pain needs to be let go of, though. The point here is to give yourself the gift of seeking out help to rid yourself if you are in pain. Start fresh again, even if for only once in your life. Choose to be free.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Listen to your pain; it\u2019s telling you something, telling you that you must do something about it. The problem is that we feel it, but we don\u2019t acknowledge it. Just like a broken leg tells you it\u2019s broken, your spirit also tells you it\u2019s broken too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The pain that we carry around could be minimal, or it could be monumental. I have heard that what doesn\u2019t kill us, makes us stronger, and that suffering causes greatness. I don\u2019t necessarily believe this as I believe it leaves pain wounds in our soul and, unless we intentionally choose to heal it, we have a problem.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Most of us think we are healing our pain by getting better at handling it. To solve your inner problems is to quit letting your mind mislead you. I don\u2019t think time heals all wounds either. Time makes them a little easier to take, but we all know if we let ourselves go there, we can bring back the pain like it was day one. How we do this is by holding in that exact memory of when we first arrived at the pain. We can go back there again and again if we let ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When we think no one will love us and we are alone, or we will always be alone, or there will never be someone for us, we are dealing with our minds personal dilemma. When we do find someone, and the relationship doesn\u2019t solve the issues that we have, we have an internal disturbance. We realize the void is still within us, and then we move onto something else because the pain is always there. But the real problem is we take our baggage wherever we go, and we want to give it to someone else to carry, all the while picking up more as we go along.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Freeing ourselves from pain is a matter of unloading the memory and detaching the connection we have to it and then allowing it to diminish. It will take time, and it will take a conscious effort to do it, but it can be done. If you have lost a loved one, you will have pain. In time it will get better. You will always have the good memories.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0There are no boundaries that we must live in, just the ones we create.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p20\"><span class=\"s1\">Real growth means dealing with discomfort, like it or not. Many times the actions we take are to avoid something. Stop avoiding and don\u2019t let issues upset you. If you are avoiding pain and you encounter what you can\u2019t avoid, then walk alongside it until it passes. And, if you do nothing else, don\u2019t take things personally. Much of what goes on around you has absolutely nothing to do with you,<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p20\"><span class=\"s1\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"p10\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Controlling the middle-age weight gain!<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7537\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/43694466_s-400x280-1-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" \/> How to keep your weight down at middle age\r\n<h2 class=\"p21\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">9 Ways To Not Over Eat<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m going to admit it! \u00a0I way overeat and then wonder why I feel bad both physically and mentally.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I do good for a while, and then I decide that I want pizza, pasta or fries! \u00a0I eat healthy about 80% of the time, and that used to be just fine when I was younger, but now, it\u2019s not so good.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I could eat 80% clean and then 20% bad but, it\u2019s come down to either my metabolism is slowing down as I\u2019ve gotten older or, I\u2019m eating way more food than I want to believe.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So, I have decided that I\u2019m not going up a clothing size and, I\u2019m for sure not going to increase my workouts from five days to seven days so, the only thing left to do (other than give in a eat whatever the hell I want) is to stop overeating!<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Here are the\u00a09 Ways To Not Over Eat:<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7436\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/42354677_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" \/> 9 ways to not overeat\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s what I do when I want to get into shape fast!<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">When you wake up if you eat breakfast, package it up and bring it with you to work, school or wherever you go with about 200 calories.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Try and delay eating that breakfast until mid-morning.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Eat a small snack an hour or two later (about 100 calories or less) like yogurt, nuts, a piece of cheese, teaspoon of peanut butter with celery, etc. at lunch.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Eat your lunch later in the day, say around 1:00 or 2:00 pm. and eat a meal that is about 300 calories with protein, carbs, and veggies.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Eat a<\/span><span class=\"s5\">nother snack in the afternoon with about 100 calories.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">When you get home, before dinner, drink a green smoothie with about 100 to 150 calories.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Eat a small dinner with about 300 calories with protein, carbs, veggies.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Have a small snack no later than an hour before bed about 50 to 100 calories.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">This is about 1150 \u2013 1200 calories. \u00a0If you stick with this, you won\u2019t be hungry, and you will lose weight!

This is using an attachment to make spaghetti zucchini noodles and then cut up tomatoes, one teaspoon olive oil, salt, pepper, shredded basil and, a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Heat in microwave for about two minutes. \u00a0It\u2019s lovely and filling and, about 160 calories!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">8. \u00a0When you do eat a meal, consume lots of veggies. \u00a0I eat 80% veggies and then 20% protein. \u00a0Others will tell you to probably reverse this, and yes, protein does make you feel fuller, however, I think with regards to health and aging, we need those phytonutrients that plants provide rather than too much protein which is acidic to the body. Plants neutralize our body.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">9. \u00a0When you want to eat, step back and ask yourself if you are really hungry? \u00a0Is it habit, boredom or, are you hungry? \u00a0If you are then, go ahead and eat! \u00a0If you can wait, go do something for a while and come back to eating.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">10. \u00a0Always have small GO TO meals in your fridge or freezer to pop in the microwave, that way you won\u2019t stand in pantry grazing and overeating.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">11. \u00a0Okay, number eleven is a mini list<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u00a0Hydrate, get enough sleep, drink hot green tea, take in a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, keep tempting food out of the house, use small plates for your meals.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This isn\u2019t a diet of any kind. \u00a0Only mindful ways to keep you from overeating, eating when you\u2019re not hungry or, binge eating because of boredom.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What I also do is, when I find myself constantly thinking about eating while at home, I take my keys, jump in my car and go to the mall and WALK around. \u00a0Of course, I always find something that I don\u2019t need but, I\u2019m working on that too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This is how I keep the weight off and eat a ton!\u00a0I love to eat. \u00a0Frankly, I wake up, and as soon as I open my eyes, I think about eating.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Today I went to lunch with my business partner and I ate a salad with Yogurt dressing, cabbage, spinach, vegetable soup, salsa, and tea sweetened with Stevia and, that was my second meal of the day! \u00a0I usually eat about five times a day plus snacks.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, my business partner had chicken fried steak, mash potatoes, and water.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Who do you think ate more calories? \u00a0Not me. My business partner did of course. Sure, I ate more food but not even as many calories as he did.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">See that\u2019s the thing, you can eat a lot (and I mean a lot) may be more than you probably eat now and still maintain or lose weight.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Whenever I go out to eat with others, they ask me if I have a hollow leg. \u00a0Really? \u00a0I wish. \u00a0I don\u2019t have a hollow leg, and I wasn\u2019t blessed with a high metabolism either. \u00a0My mother told me \u201d You were born the big-boned one in the family\u201d (thanks mom). In fact, does anyone have a high metabolism anyways?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Sure, there are some exceptions to the rule but when it comes right down to it, we either eat too much or we don\u2019t.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Working out is good but not as important as what you eat. \u00a0If all we needed to do to stay thin was to work out thirty minutes to an hour per day, then we could eat all the food we wanted right? Wrong. \u00a0Not even athletes can do this.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The thing is that it\u2019s the type of food and in what combinations that we eat. \u00a0Going back to my business partner, a chicken fried steak paired with mash potatoes, that will put weight on us. Not to mention that the side effects of that type of food are probably not good for our health.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">However, this blog post is not about lecturing anyone on the ways to eat for better health (although eating this way will make you more healthy). \u00a0 Nope, this blog post is about showing you the ways that you can eat a ton of food, never be hungry and most importantly, satisfy your taste buds.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s face it; no one likes to eat boring food or starve themselves. \u00a0Honestly, when I don\u2019t eat a lot, I\u2019m a bit grouchy, and no one likes a grouch. \u00a0I could never just not eat because my stomach hurts and I get a bit spacey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> I\u00a0love people and food too much because food should be enjoyed. \u00a0No one ever had fun while out to dinner with someone who pretends not to be hungry.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0 Why fight it!

This will not only eliminate waste but hydrate you as well.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you hate water, combine lemon and a little plant sweetener called Stevia. \u00a0Drink decaf, green tea too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Be sure not to drink all of your water at once because this can be dangerous.\u00a0 Drink it during a 24 hour period.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p61\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">Avoid processed foods and try to eat clean.<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Try not to eat any processed foods. That means don\u2019t eat any food from your pantry, with the exception of certain proteins (see below).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat fresh food like vegetables, low glycemic fruits and, nuts.\u00a0 Try and eat as natural as possible without overcooking.\u00a0 Like raw, smoothies, salads, or, steamed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eliminate the following: \u00a0caffeine (or cut in half), sugar, flour and, alcohol.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat whole foods.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p62\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">Your goal is to seek out and consume antioxidants.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat bright colored veggies.\u00a0 They are full of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals and, your liver loves these because phytochemicals help activate liver enzymes that remove harmful substances from our bodies.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">They also help with inflammation (a big factor in disease) and nourish your gut.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Limit meat consumption but get protein from other sources like tofu, nuts, beans, Quinoa, seeds, lentils, Tempeh, pea and rice protein, nut milks, chickpeas, etc.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Besides meat having a ton of growth hormones and antibiotics that you don\u2019t need, meat can contribute to disease and stay undigested in our systems for longer than we need.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You don\u2019t need to stop eating meat if you don\u2019t want to, however, for this 3-day detox and rejuvenation plan, try to let your body rest from having to work too hard.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p62\"><span class=\"s5\">Try and eat organic<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s unfortunate that in order to eat healthily we have to pay more for organic but, it\u2019s the way it is and your body has to choose between cleaning off the pesticides or nourishing your body.\u00a0 When you eat organic, you give your detox system a break, so that it can work on giving your body the nutrients that it needs.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can\u2019t afford organic, then wash the heck out of fruits and veggies when you consume the skin.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"p62\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s5\"

payoffs because they help your gut fend off bad bacteria and provide good fiber.\u00a0 Fiber is what we are also going for.\u00a0 We need to mop up all the bad cholesterol and eliminate waste.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I get mine in the produce aisle where they have the vegetarian cold foods.\u00a0 You can always get these at Whole Foods too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p61\"><span class=\"s5\">The last step in our 3-day detox and rejuvenation plan is to get it all out!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Being

It only takes a few minutes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The next day or so, your skin will peel a little or flake.\u00a0 Viola! This is the old texture and new skin coming through.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Do this every two weeks to see good results.\u00a0 Keep your new skin covered with sunscreen and keep using your Retin-A.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Using Retin-A, peels, and, sunscreen will work in synergy to give you that beautiful baby skin!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p68\"><span class=\"s1\">Look Younger For Less Money!<\/span><span class=\"s13\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Basic cosmetic procedures that are the least expensive and would be a natural progression after skin care. Compared to products, cosmetic procedures are not a commodity so finding bargain cosmetic procedures may not be a good thing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We\u2019re talking about wounding the skin, and this doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with cheaper. However, there is no reason you can\u2019t call around to your local dermatologists or plastic surgeons to find out what the procedures cost.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Then you can compare for yourself. I pick three or four good doctors or medical spas in my area and check their prices, and then I get on their email list. Before long, I get discounted offers of up to thirty percent off their procedures.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s worth it to compare and get on their lists. You\u2019ll get weekly emails from all the places you signed up at to compare the prices. You can even call your favorite doctor or spa and ask if they will match prices. They do it all the time!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Botox<\/i> \u2013 You should get Botox as a prevention measure. You may only need ten units or so just to prevent frown lines or lines that may be forming between your nose and eyes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can also have Botox used on your crow\u2019s feet (the lines around your eyes). This helps tremendously. If you need thirty or forty units and you can\u2019t afford it all at once, then get ten units every few weeks until you get all areas covered.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost varies, but I have paid up to fourteen-dollars a unit. When I got on the doctors\u2019 or Spa lists, I received discounts and now I only pay about nine to ten dollars per unit. That\u2019s a pretty good savings. Some doctors will have a buy two get one free promotion.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, there are competing products to Botox. Because they\u2019re competing with Botox, they may be less money. Botox, which is owned by Allergen, has a loyalty program, as well. I recently received a coupon for $100 off the total cost of my Botox!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This program is called BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS. Make sure you sign up or have your doctor\/injector sign you up and every time you get Botox or another Allergan product such as Juvederm, etc. you will receive points towards your next service.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I almost got my most recent Botox for free!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Chemical Peel<\/i> \u2013 A chemical peel is great for removing the surface layer of the skin. The process wounds the skin, which causes it to heal itself by creating new collagen. A chemical peel has different strengths so the cost will vary.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In most states, a chemical peel will cost about $150 to \u00a0$200 in a doctor\u2019s office. You\u2019ll want to continue having peels, as they will help create beautiful skin with less texture and, diminish fine lines.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can do them yourself, but start with a low strength. \u00a0Unfortunately, in my learning process, I bought a thirty-percent TCA peel online (I should not have been able to purchase this strength peel without a license), and I did some serious damage to my skin. Damage so bad that, I have to hide the scars every day of my life. It\u2019s not the worth the risk to try and skip ahead rather than to start slow or let a professional do it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to do your own peel, start with a small patch of skin to see how it will react. I do my own peels every two to four weeks, usually no more than twice a month. You can go to <i>skin-peel.com<\/i> to find them.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The secret to making peels comfortable is while they are on your face, use your blow dryer on the cool setting or, use a small hand fan pointed at your face. It makes a difference.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Retin-A<\/i> \u2013 A prescription is required, but Retin-A is fantastic!! \u201cRetin-A (tretinoin) is a topical preparation of vitamin A, which has antioxidant properties, just like the vitamin by itself. It\u2019s an acid derivative of retinol (vitamin A). \u00a0If you don't want to get a prescription then you can now get a good one over the counter called <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2MiKxZs\"><strong>Differin Gel\u00a0<\/strong><\/a>sold at most stores.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The important aspect is really the effectiveness of what Retin-A does. Studies have shown that Retin-A can help reduce wrinkles, reduce acne, exfoliate dead skin cells and redistribute melanin. Melanin redistribution results in lighter, more even skin color. Thus Retin-A is often used to treat skin discolorations caused by excessive sun exposure.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have sensitive skin, it may not work for you, it may be too harsh, but there are alternatives with lesser concentrations. \u00a0I would still try to mix a little every other night in my favorite cream. Just don\u2019t give up. This stuff is amazing!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Teeth Whitening<\/i> \u2013 This makes a huge difference. You could have perfect skin and straight teeth, but if your teeth are stained and dull, no one will notice. If you have bright, white teeth, you\u2019ll look better, and younger, and feel better too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost in my state is about $50.00, which is down from $500 when I first had it done. There are many good ones over the counter too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">IPL-, which stands for intense pulse light or flash lamp therapy, is a noninvasive and non-ablative treatment that uses high intensity pulses of visible light to improve the appearance of birthmarks, port wine stains, broken facial veins, rosy cheeks, rosacea, red thread veins of the legs, freckles, age spots, facial lines and wrinkles, and the removal of unwanted dark hair. The procedure is referred to as photo rejuvenation and requires a series of treatments.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost nationally runs about $300 to $400. You should only need a few treatments. I have seen it as low as $150 per treatment if you agree to three or more.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Just a quick note: I have been using a product called Black Magic Tattoo remover (it\u2019s a small handheld pulse light machine) to remove a lot of my brown spots on my arms and legs.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It works the same as an IPL machine. \u00a0I got it on Amazon.com however, it takes time.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I wouldn\u2019t use the machine on my face though. It\u2019s important to know that brown spots on the body are very hard to remove. The light process takes time. I also add a skin bleach and put a little of my skin peel on each spot too when I do peels on my face.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Dermapen or Micro-Needling \u2013 \u201c Sterile surgical stainless micro-needles pierce the skin leading to apoptosis of cells in the dermis.\u201d \u201cWhat is Apoptosis? Apoptosis or programmed cell death is when a cell essentially commits suicide. This process is natural, controlled and routine. Little inflammation is caused.\u201d \u201cThe Dermapen uses eleven, 33-gauge microneedles to stimulate the dermis. Needles vertically pierce the skin to enhance rejuvenation results. Small holes are punctured at a rate of 1000\/second.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s2\">This proliferation of the body\u2019s tissue continues to release growth factors from fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and monocytes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Note: I have had <i>Dermapen<\/i> about six times and it works wonders. It\u2019s comparable to lasers like Fraxel but without all the downtime and expense. Many doctors will give you a discount if you buy a package of four or more. You can save hundreds by doing this. I paid $150 per treatment vs. $300 \u2013 $350 by buying the package.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Juvederm<\/i> \u2013 Juvederm is an injectable filler consisting mostly of hyaluronic acid. It\u2019s used to fill in areas to smooth out wrinkles and deep folds on the face and can last up to a year. You can pay anywhere from $400 a syringe to $800. I pay only about $400 \u2013 $450 depending on the specials the doctors have. Currently, my doctor has\u00a0a buy one get one free, and I can save the second one for a later time. At first, you may need two but, as your own stem cells work, you will need less later. \u00a0In my case, it lasts about six months.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">These are certainly not all of the basic cosmetic procedures available, but these tend to be the least expensive and the least invasive. These procedures really do well with regard to anti-aging and reversing past damage.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">They\u2019re also a good alternative to going under the knife. I think one day these products and procedures will be affordable for all of us.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">With today\u2019s technology, the need for doctors to perform invasive procedures will diminish so they\u2019ll be more eager to lower procedure costs to attract more patients. My hope is that you get the best skin possible without having to figure out where you will get the money.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s face it, many of us want to take care of ourselves but, products and procedures can be a little expensive.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Hormones and Aging Skin<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7622\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/10684352_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"391\" height=\"274\" \/> Hormones at middle age\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Hormones help prevent skin from aging. We have all seen it, or maybe we have been troubled by the changes we\u2019re seeing in our own skin. Thin skin, sagging, dullness, lines, and wrinkles (sorry, I had to remind you).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, it happens to everyone at some time. For many of us, we want to look as young as we feel, however, sometimes the outside is not so accommodating to the inside. As we age, especially starting in our thirties and forties, our hormones begin to decline and then diminish over time.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Because of this, our skin becomes fragile, thin, wrinkled and, sags. If you have gone through menopause then you should know that it\u2019s been stated that, we will lose thirty percent of our skin\u2019s collagen in the first five years after menopause! Ouch! You can counter this effect! We can use oral hormones or hormone creams (prescribed by a doctor) to increase collagen support.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I personally am not one for taking synthetic hormones, as I believe there is an increased risk of breast cancer and other harmful effects. I use a bioidentical hormone cream prescribed by my doctor.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Does it help my skin? I like to think so. For me, it\u2019s been an accumulative effect of bio-identical hormones, peels, topical retinoid, vitamin C serums, sunscreen, supplements, exercising and a semi-clean diet that keeps me and my skin balanced.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s important to have your hormones tested routinely, as you want to keep your hormones balanced. I was skeptical at first going on a bio-identical hormone treatment, as I thought if I did, I\u2019d get cancer. Because of reading and hearing that hormones cause cancer (in the wrong context), I fought taking them! Eventually, I opened up my mind and learned just the opposite.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Note: All hormone replacement therapy has some cancer risks. However, if monitored, these can be minimized.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">According to many doctors and research, balancing our hormones keeps us from getting cancer instead of the reverse. In fact, it\u2019s having very little hormones that may cause cancer in the first place or, at least can contribute to it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As I said, I personally would not take oral hormones, but that\u2019s just me and you have to make an educated decision based on what is right for you. At the very least, it\u2019s good to see where your levels are. Okay, back to my point. When you let your hormones fluctuate, it can have a negative impact on your skin. The bottom line is to get your hormones tested and get them balanced, if even just for a better quality of health.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The 4 Crucial Anti-Aging Hormones<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I wrote a post about natural hormone replacement. \u00a0I wrote specifically about the four hormones that are crucial to anti-aging.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These are, DHEA, Melatonin, \u00a0Sex Hormones such as Estrogen, Progesterone, Testosterone and, Thyroid.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Some scientists believe that if we restore these hormones to pre-decline levels, we can reverse the aging process. \u00a0They may even prime us for extra decades of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Each of the above hormones does a specific job. \u00a0DHEA is profound because it\u2019s the hormone that has the most influence on the aging process. \u00a0It alone could actually extend our lifespan.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Melatonin manages the body\u2019s sleep and awake cycle and, scavenges free radicals. \u00a0Which in turn, reduces oxidative stress in our body which then, reduces degenerative disease like cancer. \u00a0It\u2019s also the body\u2019s time clock or aging clock.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Natural estrogen and progesterone combined, help us women ease through menopause. \u00a0They also perform as a safeguard for women\u2019s health after menopause.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Testosterone replacement can help both men and women with low libido, protect against heart disease (although this is being debated right now), fight osteoporosis (even in men too), increase lean muscle mass, may reverse age-related fat accumulation and, other age-related diseases.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Thyroid affects tens of millions of people. \u00a0Millions have a thyroid issue and don\u2019t even know it. \u00a0Symptoms vary from low energy, difficulty losing weight, low immune system, anemia, heart problems, hair loss, brittle nails, depression, and the list goes on.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I have been on thyroid medication for two years and just recently, I decided I didn\u2019t need it anymore. \u00a0Ten days later, I was feeling great until I dropped a fork while putting the dishes away and cried my eyes out.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For the next two days, I felt down and I knew something was wrong. That\u2019s just not me. \u00a0The only thing that had changed was me thinking I didn\u2019t need my thyroid therapy. \u00a0When I got back on it, my mood was back to my happy self again. \u00a0Placebo? \u00a0I don\u2019t think so. \u00a0I need thyroid medicine whether I like it or not.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, you will need a blood test to determine what your hormone levels are. \u00a0It\u2019s almost certain that, if you are in middle-age and beyond, you will need to balance your hormones.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s true that\u00a0medical experts disagree about the significance of a Testosterone decline, and whether the health benefits of HRT outweigh the risks.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">HRT (hormone replacement therapy) is something you will have to carefully consider for yourself and whether it\u2019s right for you.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you decide to do HRT, please be careful to work with your doctor and not with some unknown source on the internet. \u00a0It only takes the smallest amount of hormones to be effective, conversely, the same is true for damage to be done too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Lastly, if you do HRT, try and do natural hormones. \u00a0I do bio-identical which are made by a Compound Pharmacist. \u00a0It\u2019s important to know that, just because it\u2019s a natural hormone doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s without risk.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s a little side note that my doctor told me. \u00a0When I was worried about taking hormones because of a breast cancer risk or any cancer risk whatsoever, she said \u201cTheresa, you have more of a risk for cancer by not balancing your hormones.\u201d \u00a0I\u2019m putting my faith in my doctor and in my research.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It makes sense because the longer we live the more exposure we have to the things that cause cancer right? So, if we keep our hormones balanced (they make the biggest decisions for our body) then wouldn\u2019t it be true that without them, we have less of a fighting chance.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h1 class=\"p69\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Do you have a thyroid problem?<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7393\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/thyroidpic.jpg\" alt=\"do you have thyroid disease\" width=\"374\" height=\"249\" \/> At home thyroid test\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class=\"p69\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">At home test below:<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s believed by many doctors that our basal metabolic temperature or BMT is the most accurate measure of thyroid function.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">We can check our own BMT at home by using an oral thermometer.\u00a0 Not a digital one.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">This is how you do it:<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<em>Note: \u00a0Please do not use this as medical advice. \u00a0Please see your doctor for a proper diagnosis.<\/em>\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you are ready to go to bed, shake an oral thermometer down and put it next to your bed where you can easily reach it in the morning.

I\u2019ve been to nursing homes plenty of times and it was heartbreaking to see people sitting in wheelchairs all lined up against the wall. \u00a0To me, I felt like they were just stuck there until it was time to die.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I know we are all going to get old and we\u2019re all going to die but, it\u2019s the way that we\u2019re going to do it that is important.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t just start taking random supplements because some can have adverse effects on your health like taking iron if you don\u2019t need it, etc.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I would advise that you talk to a professional. \u00a0Maybe a nutritionist. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure if doctors know about nutrition these days as they are probably overloaded as it is trying to keep up with our general healthcare requirements. \u00a0You will also need a blood test.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I have created a \u201c<i>Better Health\/Anti-Aging Supplement Guide<\/i>\u201d that I use and I swear by. You can download it from the link below.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m not some fanatic meaning, I don\u2019t believe that we have to take handfuls of supplements. \u00a0We just need some basic ones and I\u2019ve put the link below if you want to check them out.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As always though, please check with your doctor before starting a supplement program because they also can interfere with medication.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So the take away here is eating a variety of nutritious foods, cut out the saturated fat and sugar, and supplement your diet for a healthier and longer life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">How to handle a changing appearance<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7319\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/20081488_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"273\" \/> How to handle fading looks\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The truth is, in middle age, if we don\u2019t begin to find peace while aging, we better get a grip on it now! If you were always a stunning beauty, then you had fifty or more years of outside aesthetics, but know this is not your power.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Your power now has to come from within. If God wills and you take care of yourself, you will hopefully have at least another thirty or forty years to live your truth within. This is when the real living begins.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This will be your new power, which has nothing to do with what\u2019s on the outside. You can\u2019t control that anymore. Maybe this is what we are really afraid of. In middle age, it\u2019s hard to control anything anymore, especially our looks and our bodies.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Just try to maintain your health and remain positive, and the rest will take care of itself. How can you find your new you? Start by being kind and gentle with yourself, just like you would for a friend who came to you for advice about the fears of aging. You would never be as harsh to a friend as you are to yourself. Be your own best friend. It makes a difference.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to find out what great qualities you have other than your looks, ask your partner, your friends, and your kids about how you may have touched their lives in a positive way.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Listen to all the wonderful stories they will tell you about you. They will tell you things that will touch your heart and make you proud of who you are. Notice when they tell you about you, they never tell you about how good you looked, only about how wonderful you are or how unselfish you may be and, how much you are loved by everyone.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s a great freedom to let go of the fear of aging. Once you do this, and you really accept it, a great peace will come over you. You no longer have to spend wasted time on ways to stay and look younger.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You will no longer waste time comparing yourself to the younger generation or spending money on things just to keep up with the outside world. Just think about how much extra money and time you will have when you let go and age with kindness toward yourself.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can now travel and do whatever you want. You are still you only better. Remember there is nothing broken about us because we have aged. We don\u2019t have to fix our face or change our bodies for anyone, only unless we want to for us.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Should you choose to do anything to yourself, do it because it will make you feel better and because of you and only you want to do it. Don\u2019t let your partner talk you into or out of whatever makes you feel happy about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You will never fool Mother Nature, nor will you outrun aging, but if it makes you feel better than do it! You will never be here again, so make it count for you.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">One day we won\u2019t worry about the wrinkles we have, and what we do or don\u2019t look like, because the real worry will be about our mortality. The point here is to live and not burden ourselves about aging, because we will all age and, one day, what we look like will be the least of our concerns.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Our concerns will then be about how to live each day healthy and free from pain. What used to make us uneasy about aging will hopefully only be an issue that we will have let go of so that we may enjoy the time we have left.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Enjoy the time you have left. Go and do everything you want to do without fear, without judgment, and without guilt.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you change the way you look as you age?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7513 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/30576356_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"Like the way that you look as you age\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" \/> Do you like the way you look as you age?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em><strong><span class=\"s1\">Older women are the most dangerous on the planet. We have nothing to lose!<\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p70\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em><strong><span class=\"s1\">~Jane Fonda<\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Are we happy in the circumstances we are in or have we settled as we have gotten older? <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s face it; aging requires change. We can\u2019t wear those sexy clothes we once wore, or wear the same makeup as when we were sixteen because that would be ridiculous. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">To some, this may seem sad, even like a death sentence, to be forced to make changes that we don\u2019t want to. Unfortunately, and fortunately, we have to make sure we make changes as we age. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Many women don\u2019t change, and they continue to do the same things they always did. Big mistake because you are not the same person you were when you were twenty, thirty, or even five years ago.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Life is moving faster, even when we feel we are slowing down. Look at it like this, you were a teen once and you wore stuff you wouldn\u2019t dream of wearing now. You naturally changed as you went into your twenties. Somewhere along the way, we stopped and got stuck.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> We continue to wear the same things and styles, year after year, decade after decade, without noticing that we need an update or, we do notice, but we nothing about it. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe it\u2019s because we get caught in a time gap. Are we still young, middle age, old or what? How do we perceive ourselves at middle age? At what point or decade do we make the necessary changes that should be made for our forever changing self?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The short answer is to look back at pictures, and if you have looked the same for the last ten, fifteen, twenty years or longer, you need a serious update. Don\u2019t panic, because it\u2019s not hard to do. A little change in your hairstyle, color, makeup and clothes, and you are all set. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I look at magazines for women my age, and I find inspiration through catalogs that cater to women over forty. It has served me well. In fact, I change a little too much. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I change my hair color at least every six months. It\u2019s probably not the best thing to change so often. My son was horrified when he knocked on my bedroom door the other day to ask me a question, and when I opened the door to answer him, he looked shocked and yelled out, \u201cMom, your hair is blue!\u201d That statement didn\u2019t even faze my daughter, who was sitting at the kitchen table. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">She didn\u2019t even bother to look my way because she knows me so well, and this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that I shock someone with the things I do to myself. It\u2019s just who I am and I happen to like it. By the way, the blue color was accidental. You see I had blonde hair, and one afternoon I decided I might look better with black hair.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">It was a funny mistake because the tint in the black dye turned my blonde hair blue (sounds like a country song doesn\u2019t it?). I didn\u2019t panic; did I mention it\u2019s not my first time? My son, the tattletale that he is, couldn\u2019t wait to call his dad to inform him that his wife has blue hair. My husband, being a person that doesn\u2019t like change, and who had the lucky draw to be married to a person who does, was yet again, baffled by why I just couldn\u2019t be like everyone else and be, in his words, \u201cnormal.\u201d He does admit though, I keep him on his toes because he never knows who he will come home to. I rest my case! Change is a good thing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Where Women Go As We Age<\/span><\/h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Jb6mfy\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Jb6mfy<\/a><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8225\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-3.38.17-PM-204x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"204\" height=\"300\" \/> <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Jb6mfy\">Where women go. The reality of middle-age<\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What are we waiting for? We can\u2019t wait for the future to happen and we certainly can\u2019t live in the past. In middle age and beyond, we have to come to terms with the fact that our choices have changed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For some, the changes may not be good, for others, aging is a time when we can do the things we have only dreamed of.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I am inspired by Diana Nyad, the first women to ever swim to Florida from Cuba without a cage. This is extremely inspiring because she was a sixty-four-year-old woman!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I am impressed because I know a few sixty-year-olds who believe they can\u2019t park too far away from the grocery store doors because they don\u2019t want to walk that far, let alone, swim for fifty-three hours and one hundred and ten miles.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Did I mention this was her fifth attempt? Just goes to show you that we are never too old and to never stop trying no matter what. She made her first attempt when she was twenty-eight, and then in 2011, she tried three times at the age of sixty-two, and again at sixty-three.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When she finally accomplished the swim on September 2, 2013, she had three messages for us all: one, we should never, ever give up, two, <\/span><span class=\"s5\">you\u2019re never too old to chase your dreams,<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> and three, it looks like a solitary sport, but it is a team.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Doesn\u2019t that sum up what we women are going through right now? Never give up on yourself, no matter what age you are. Enjoy your life, love yourself, and do what it is that feeds your soul. It\u2019s never too late to achieve and live your own personal dream. Just have the belief and do away with the fear.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Remember, large or small, your dream belongs to you, and it\u2019s just as important as anyone else\u2019s. We are all living our own dream and we can create a new one if we don\u2019t like the one we are in.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, you are never alone. It takes a team, meaning your friends, your family, your spouse, and your faith, especially faith in yourself. Whatever it is around you that lifts you and inspires you is what you are meant to be. It is important to always be mindful, moreover, keep an open mind.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You never know when the universe is offering you a gift, and if you are not awake, then you will miss opportunities and the energy will go elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Too many times we get up, go to work, come home and then go to bed without taking even one second to appreciate the gift of life and what it has to offer us. For those of us who ask why are we here? The quick answer is to take a look around and embrace the gift of life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The experience of being born may be the only reason we are here. We don\u2019t need to create chaos trying to make a bigger meaning than necessary, otherwise, we waste the time we have. Sure it\u2019s great if you are able to leave a legacy, but even if you don\u2019t, its okay too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The only wasted life is a life not lived fully. What does fully mean to you? If we embrace the experience of life without thinking there is an attachment, then we are living a life that is meant to be and, therefore, we receive the blessings that come with it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The one day I will get there is now, and it\u2019s a fork, and you must take the right path that makes you happy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Our culture teaches us that we won\u2019t ever get there; therefore, we are in a constant state of searching and wondering what\u2019s next. I hope you realize your unique beauty and find the energy within right now, this moment. Every second counts.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This day too will pass and you will never get it back. Whatever holds you back now, you will look back in three or four years and realize how fantastic you really were. You will question why you stayed in certain states of mind, relationships, jobs or whatever held you back in the past.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As we get older, we tend to think we are more tired, especially women, because we are still thinking we can do it all. There are two kinds of energy. One is when you are tired and don\u2019t feel like doing anything. You may feel a bit down on yourself; you decide you don\u2019t have any energy to engage in life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This energy level is the one when you haven\u2019t slept or you need to eat, so you do and you get your energy back. The second energy level is when you have slept, eaten and still, you have no energy to enjoy life or to engage with others. Perhaps dare I say the word depressed? If you ate more or slept more, you would not find your energy in this state.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">However, if suddenly your lottery ticket won or your soul mate came into your life in an instant, you would find your energy! This is the kind of energy you should strive to tap into. Wake up as though you have won the lottery of life, and you love yourself enough, more than anyone else could ever. You have the energy to live with excitement, just remove the negativity that is draining it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to live in real moments in time. There is a book called <i>Real Moments<\/i> by Barbara De Angelis. If you take your life and your minutes for granted, then you should read this book. It will not only show you how to feel the sun on your face and the wind in your hair, it will show you how to live like you should before you die and actually feel like you live in the moment.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I know this may sound like a circular question, but there is a difference between going through the motions and living in the moment. When you actually live in the moment, time seems to stand still and you feel every experience and sensation happening in that moment. You owe it to yourself to live this way.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><i>MAKING PEACE WITH AGING<\/i><\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7517 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/21783809_l1-400x280-1-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"making peace with aging\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" \/> Making peace with aging\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>\u00a0<\/i><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Making peace with aging, Hmmm? How does a woman make peace with aging in a culture obsessed with youth?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It doesn\u2019t matter what age we are, the issue may change but the focus on aging remains the same. And that focus is how to keep a youthful appearance, stay healthy and remain active.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s great for an aging woman to center around taking care of herself, but it\u2019s another matter to obsess about getting old, and, yet, at some point we all do it. I guess you could say I\u2019m lucky because my appearance was never stunning, but I felt beautiful anyways.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I can age graciously by making peace with aging because I was, and still am, an ordinary woman, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s the beautiful women I feel for because they seem to be the people having the hardest time with aging.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I really believe when you are ordinary looking like myself, you age more lovely than when you have already reached your peak. However, all women get to the same place eventually, and there is no escaping it. But beauty is all relative anyway.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Sure, I look back at pictures and see my taught skin, my shapely body, my vibrant eyes and the youth that I didn\u2019t appreciate, and I am reminded again how fast life really goes by. With this reminder, I gain a moment of happiness because I also realize I am healthy, happy and look relatively good for my age.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I know life could be worse, so I don\u2019t dwell on the past or question what God has given me. It won\u2019t change where I am today or where I will be tomorrow. It would be wise to make peace with aging sooner than later just in case there is a little more work to do down the road.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Life is a creation in progress, and it shouldn\u2019t be that we are looking and waiting for the end, because that could come for anyone on any day. As we all know, there are no guarantees that we will have another day beyond this one.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I have heard it said that, if you don\u2019t feel old by the time you hit fifty, you soon will. If we live long enough, half of our lives will be spent as older women. I have never thought about it like this before. When I was young, I said I wanted to live forever!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, I just want to live a good life and be happy while I am here. I don\u2019t think the answer to getting old is lying about our age, either. Some women add a few years to their age when asked so that others might say they look good for their age.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">How can this make us feel good because we, if no one else, still know how old we really are? Don\u2019t fall into the trap of being afraid to tell your age. Just making it another year is a miracle at any age, young or old<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Free yourself to let grow old compassionately<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-7525 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/meandbrandi-2-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"Grow old with compassion for yourself\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" \/> Grow old with compassion for yourself\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Call it growing old, getting old, aging, or whatever you want to call the inevitable. Getting old is going to happen no matter what. As we move towards the later years and age, there is something we still have yet to do and that is to forgive.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Forgive ourselves and forgive others, to let go and free ourselves to grow old with compassion for ourselves. Maybe we could have been better wives, mothers, sisters, givers, or whatever you may have regrets about, so what, the past is the past and it no longer matters anymore.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s done is done, now it\u2019s about being kind to yourself. If you need to let others know what you now realize, then let them know and ask for forgiveness, forgive them if you need to and move on.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Whatever we have been searching for outside of ourselves is already within us. There is nothing to find out there that we don\u2019t already have inside. I talk to or hear about many older people that are deeply sad about the past. Maybe its things they wished they had done or wished they hadn\u2019t done.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are holding in sadness, despair, regret or any other emotion that you may be attributing to unhappiness, then just let it go. If you can do something about it, do it now and do it quickly, but don\u2019t dwell on it. Whatever the past was, it doesn\u2019t equal the future and the future is now. There is no reason not to forgive ourselves for whatever mistakes we have made in the past even if they were made only by omission.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to grow old, we must not fear growing old. The biggest problem that we all have, both men and women, is fear. We are afraid to live, to be alive, and to risk being ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Nothing defines us like death, and yet death is not our greatest fear, but genuinely living is the real fear. We have all had bad luck, bad breaks, heartbreak, or things didn\u2019t turn out the way we wanted them, however, we and the world still keep going.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">We have to get old. \u00a0We have no choice, but we continue to hold in pain and, with every breath, we don\u2019t let it out. We have to let go of pain and release it along with the blame and guilt. If you can\u2019t do this, then you owe it to yourself, and to those who love you, to make peace with yourself so that you can fully live and love those around you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\nThanks for

EndyMed work?","content":"<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Does EndyMed work?<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOkay, ladies. \u00a0Have you seen the commercials about how to get rid of crepey skin? \u00a0You know the body lotion that claims to tighten your skin and make it look youthful again?\r\n\r\nI won't say the name of the product that claims to do this but, I will say that I have tried that product and it DOES NOT WORK.\r\n\r\nLong story short, I am in my fifties and I abused my skin for most of my life by laying in the tanning beds and in the sun. \u00a0My skin is both crepey and the elasticity is compromised.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help either that I am in menopause and now my collagen formation is at an all-time low.\r\n\r\nI tried working out a lot and lifting heavy weights and although it helped, it didn't get rid of the crepeyness\u00a0of my skin.\r\n\r\nOne day I was in my doctor's office and he had a poster on the wall that said \"EndyMed\" for tighter skin.\r\n\r\nNow, I am a pretty skeptical person but even saying that I try just about everything at least once to verify\u00a0my skepticism. \u00a0I inquired about the EndyMed and they explained that it works by allowing energy to be delivered deep down into the skin in virtually a painless manner.\r\n\r\nIt uses multiple generators to ping pong the energy to a deep level of the skin. \u00a0It's used as a non-invasive procedure and either in specific areas like face, neck, cheeks, legs, arms or, a whole body rejuvenation.\r\n\r\nIt's for skin tightening, acne scars, and wrinkle reduction. \u00a0It also helps with pigmentation\u00a0issues which I have all of these issues. \u00a0It's an innovative technology and the fact that the energy goes deep down to the skin surface allows collagen to reproduce thus, tightening the skin.\r\n\r\nThe wand on the machine is used in the areas of the body that you want to be tightened etc. \u00a0It heats up the skin and stimulates collagen remodeling. \u00a0They call it \"3D energy.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">So the question is, \"Does EndyMed work?\"<\/span><\/h1>\r\nI had three treatments done on my upper arms because I had cellulite and loose skin. \u00a0I also had two treatments on my inner thighs because I had sagging skin. \u00a0I was at the point where I hadn't worn shorts in two years.\r\n\r\nMy arms got about thirty percent tighter and my cellulite got about ten percent better. \u00a0The doctor said it will take about four to six treatments so I will go back and have three more.\r\n\r\nFor my legs, I saw immediate improvement and I actually wore shorts the other day and I could not believe\u00a0it! \u00a0It has been painful not wearing shorts and skirts like I did in the good old days. \u00a0I will also go back and have four more treatments on my legs to get the full effect.\r\n\r\nWith that said, in both of these cases, I increased my workouts with targeted workouts for these areas using heavier weights and specific techniques that shape these areas.\r\n\r\nI also dropped five pounds too. \u00a0Did that have anything to do with my results? \u00a0Absolutely. \u00a0Unless one is having surgery, doing something that is non-invasive only works if you work along with it.\r\n\r\nWould I have gotten results if I didn't diet and workout? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0But not as good.\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The cost for EndyMed<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the cost is pretty good. \u00a0I paid $297 for three treatments. \u00a0The treatments are spread to every other week per area. \u00a0I think it's a bargain because the emotional pain that I felt by hiding my legs for two years was well worth trading a few hundred bucks for.\r\n<h1><\/h1>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">How long does it EndyMed take?<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe procedure takes about thirty minutes for inner thighs and about the same for arms. \u00a0There is a setting they put on for each part of the body that tells them how much heat to put on and how many passovers with the wand to use. \u00a0Once the passovers are done, it's done. \u00a0Super painless and almost feels light a light massage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Facial Rejuvenation with EndyMed<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter I get the other treatments finished up. \u00a0I will go back and do my chest and my face. \u00a0I like the fact that it creates collagen and as we get older our skin sags on our face and neck because we stop producing collagen at the rate we did in our early years.\r\n\r\nI'd rather produce my own natural filler like collagen instead of getting unnatural fillers injected. \u00a0To me, it just doesn't look the same.\r\n<h1><\/h1>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Does EndyMed work?<\/span><\/h1>\r\nYes! I would say EndyMed does work and it is well worth the money :)\r\n\r\nHere is a link if you want more information on EndyMed <a

Mole and Brown Spot Removal Pen Review","content":"<h1><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Beauty Mole and Brown Spot Removal Pen Review<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/255279835\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI've had brown spots for the past ten years. \u00a0I've had procedures to burn them off. \u00a0I used acids, peels, and other things to get rid of them and no luck!\r\n\r\nI in my newsfeed I saw an ad for a spot remover pen.\r\n\r\nI bought it, and when I finally got it (after waiting a month), it wouldn't hold a charge so, needless to say, it didn't work.\r\n\r\nI did get it to hold a charge for about thirty seconds once but, again, it just didn't work.\r\n\r\nI went to Amazon.com and ordered the <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2H3yaxA\">\"Beauty Mole and Brown Spot Removal Pen\"<\/a>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Beauty Mole and Brown Spot Removal Pen Review<\/h4>\r\nAt first, I thought it was going to be like the first pen I bought because I had a hard time turning it on.\r\n\r\nTurns out, it was me being impatient and not following directions.\r\n\r\nThe thing about me is that I WANT RESULTS FAST!\r\n\r\nAfter reading the directions, I did get it to turn on and immediately it worked!\r\n\r\nThe key is to hold down the on\/off button for about five seconds and then it turns on.\r\n\r\nNext step is to put the\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2H3yaxA\">\"Beauty Mole and Brown Spot Removal Pen\"<\/a>\u00a0straight down on the spot rather than to the side.\r\n\r\nInstantly the pen starts burning the spot off. \u00a0You can smell your skin burning (I know, gross, but it works).\r\n\r\nI did two spots because I wanted to see how it heels before I move on to other areas of my body. \u00a0I have a lot of spots from sun damage and taking estrogen when I turned fifty :(\r\n\r\nSo my review of the\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2H3yaxA\">\"Beauty Mole and Brown Spot Removal Pen\"<\/a>\u00a0is good.\r\n\r\nI think it works and for $26.00 it's also a novelty in that, I have wasted far more money on anti-aging and beauty products that did way less.\r\n\r\nOne last thing. \u00a0You will have a very visible wound where you removed the spots. \u00a0It takes\u00a0about five days to heal.\r\n\r\nWhen it healed, the spot wasn't completely gone but it was fifty percent less. \u00a0I'm sure I could have gone deeper initially\r\n\r\nI'm sure I could have gone deeper initially and had better results.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can now go back over the spot and repeat the process until it's gone (I am hoping).\r\n\r\nHere's the link:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2H3yaxA\">\"Beauty Mole and Brown Spot Removal Pen\"<\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img

style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What is The Best Makeup Primer For Older Women?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you're like me and you wear makeup and you want it to last all day, you will need to use a good primer.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you're also like me and you have tried lot's primers that worked a little but, didn't work as well as you'd like them too,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 then\u00a0<\/span>I'm here to show you a wonderful primer that really does the job!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> The name of the primer is\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2DaEMYK\">\"Fenton beauty by Rihanna yes the singer Rihanna!\"<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I use it and it's amazing because<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>it's like a filter just\u00a0like the filters on our iPhones and cameras.<\/span><\/p>\r\nBut unlike the filters on our phones and cameras, we get to have flawless skin and makeup all day long.\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A little bit goes a long way. \u00a0Use it under your make up after you've applied your creams, serums and, after your sunscreen.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pump out a couple of pumps on your fingers and apply it to your face and neck.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Let it dry for a minute and then put on your makeup.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> It will last all day and your makeup will look flawless.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> It\u2019s really good for women that are middle-aged especially in our fifties, sixties, and beyond. Although it's a\u00a0good primer for any age. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The truth is, that as we get older we need products that\u00a0go the extra mile.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The reason that I think it works so well is because it doesn't settle into the wrinkles and crevices that make us look older. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\nOther primers that I have used in the past made my skin look weathered,\u00a0shiny and, blotchy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2DaEMYK\">The Best Makeup Primer For Older Women<\/a><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Again, the product is Fenty<span

be buried or cremated?","content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">To be buried or cremated?<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo be buried or cremated? \u00a0Two years ago, the woman that I never thought would age let alone pass away did in fact die.\r\n\r\nI got a call, it was unexpected (aren't most deaths anyway?) and then my mother was gone.\r\n\r\nWe never talked about where she wanted her final resting place to be but, it was something we all knew, and that was, none of us wanted to be put into the ground.\r\n\r\nSo, when she passed away, I was solely responsible for her as I lost my little brother eighteen months to the day of her passing and, my older brother was disabled due to a twenty-five-year opiate addiction in which sadly, my mother succumbed to as well.\r\n\r\nI was in charge of deciding where I would place my mothers remains.\r\n\r\nMy mother was distraught like any mother would be when she lost her youngest child. \u00a0But, she put on a brave face for the time being, and I had my baby brother cremated (mostly because it was affordable and again, no one ever talked about death in our family so what else would I do?).\r\n\r\nCremation was swift and efficient. \u00a0No long and drawn out funeral arrangements\u00a0or watching my mom fall apart next to his grave. \u00a0\u00a0 My mother was never a strong-willed person. \u00a0I always rescued her from herself and taking care of my little brother was something I had always done.\r\n\r\nWhen I offered to take my brothers ashes back to our hometown of San Diego, California, she resisted and said that she wanted them to be with her for a while. \u00a0\"Until she was ready to let them go,\" she said.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, I knew what that meant. \u00a0She too would go with my brother.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly what happened.\r\n\r\nHe passed on June 21, 2013. \u00a0She passed on December 21, 2015.\r\n\r\nI heard my cell phone right at 1:30 in the morning, looked at the number coming from my mom's house and knew instantly, that she was gone. \u00a0We all know that when a phone rings in the middle of the night, it's never good news.\r\n\r\nI drove an hour to her house. \u00a0Sat by her side on her couch. \u00a0Kissed her goodbye on the cheek and then stood back while the coroner put her frail little body into a black zip-up bag.\r\n\r\nThe coroner said he was sorry. \u00a0I watched them drive away. \u00a0I took my little brothers ashes from her coffee table, and I went back home.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas then, and I had a house full of people. \u00a0I \u00a0had little time to grieve, but crazy as it was, I called the same funeral home\u00a0the next day and arranged to have her cremated as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI couldn't wait to take her and my brother back home where they could finally be together.\r\n\r\nIt was as though it was meant to be.\r\n\r\nApril 17th, 2016 (on her birthday), I flew to San Diego with my mother and my brother tucked away tightly in my designer carry on bag.\r\n\r\nAfter the airport security opened up and checked out the ashes, I was on the plane.\r\n\r\nI chartered a boat, and right at the border of San Diego and Mexico, I released my brother and my mother.\r\n\r\nThe pain finally weighed on both my mind and my chest. \u00a0I hadn't cried until that moment.\r\n\r\nIt was relieving to cry, but it was even more relieving to see them together again.\r\n\r\nIt was beautiful, and FINALLY, they were at peace and selfishly I was too.\r\n\r\nI watched their remains drift peacefully out into the ocean while at that very moment the world stopped and I could feel every part of them and every memory of growing up with them both.\r\n\r\nI don't think I could have fully appreciated bury them in the ground.\r\n\r\nYes, when a person is cremated, no one can come and visit them. \u00a0But really, are they there?\r\n\r\nI have some peace in thinking that I let them go and they are patiently waiting for me rather than me going to a cemetery when I know darn well they are not there.\r\n\r\nI'd rather know that somewhere out there; my soul is released and then maybe, if there is another life, I will drift back again.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>If you're interested in seeing their burial at sea, \u00a0I have posted the video below for you to check out. \u00a0I was using my iPhone while my husband released their ashes.<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/251253286\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I hope there is life after death and they know that they are together again. \u00a0I hope they are with everyone that passed before them. \u00a0I hope they are happy. \u00a0You know, in a way that we don't understand just yet?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So the question of \"To be buried or cremated?\" Is most likely to be answered by how your family usually deals with death throughout their history or, like mine, doesn't deal with it at all thus, \u00a0 having to create my traditions. \u00a0I hope I was right in making the decision I made and when I look back at the video, I know that I was.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I hope I was right in making the decision I made and when I look back at the video, I know that I was.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Yes, I will be cremated, and I will be put at the same longitude and latitude at sea.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I used to think that if you talked about your death and where you want your remains to go, that it would create a bad omen. \u00a0That's not how I feel, and I have let my husband and my kids know where I finally be.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">That's not how I feel now, and I have let my husband and my kids know my wishes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Until then, I am going to live like there is no tomorrow :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">To be buried or cremated?<\/p>\r\n<p

\/><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCoconutPods are all natural and organic, moisturizing body melts.\r\n\r\nI created this product because I was diagnosed with all kinds of autoimmune issues like thyroid disease, shingles, arthritis and, gland problems.\r\n\r\nMy skin was having all kinds of issues from feeling dry to looking crepey.\r\n\r\nI would do like most of us do and get out of the shower or bath and grab a bottle of lotion full of all kinds of chemicals.\r\n\r\nI would start applying from my neck down to the bottoms of my feet. \u00a0My skin was drenched in chemicals that I couldn't even pronounce or, that I even knew what the heck they were.\r\n\r\nOf course, I did this for years until I hit my middle forties when I got shingles. \u00a0It was a bit too early in life to get shingles as most people that have them get them later in life.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of my autoimmune journey on a down hill spiral.\r\n\r\nShortly after that, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease. \u00a0It's a disease where your immune system attacks your thyroid gland.\r\n\r\nI had nodules (growths in my thyroid) that had to be biopsied and still have to be once a year to check for cancer.\r\n\r\nI won't bore you with the fact that one ailment leads to the next and the next and then, more and more medicine to treat the issues. \u00a0It was a total nightmare trying to adjust to my new life.\r\n\r\nI got tired of feeling like hell all of the time, so I decided to find out what was causing my problems.\r\n\r\nAfter reading that the types of health issues that I was going through were very common in today's environment. \u00a0Moreover, they are dramatically increasing at alarming rates.\r\n\r\nIs it the plastic in our water, chemicals in the air, pollution in our food, chemicals in our lotions?\r\n\r\nI am not a doctor or scientist, and frankly, I could research all of the reasons and write about what those folks think the problem is but, to me, it comes down to common sense.\r\n\r\nFACT:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>The skin is the largest organ of the human body.<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>In a 120 pound person, the skin;<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>Covers 3000 square inches<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>Weighs 6 pounds<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nCommon sense to me means that I begin to look around and find out what the heck was causing my issues.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I am a vegetarian, work out, drink lots of water, supplement and, I have no history of any of the stuff I was going through in my family.\r\n\r\nI couldn't do much better on my food because I was already eating organic. \u00a0I only drank purified water (and wine) nothing else.\r\n\r\nI supplemented according to my yearly checkups to keep me healthy.\r\n\r\nI had no bad habits so what the heck gives?\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong>What are CoconutPods?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\nAfter I had read that our skin is the largest organ of our body (next to our liver I guess), I took a good look around, and I was disturbed to see that I had a couple of hundred beauty products just laying around.\r\n\r\nThe worse part is that I decided to read a lot of the labels. \u00a0I was beside myself. \u00a0I was a little mad at both myself and the product manufacturers.\r\n\r\nHere is why. \u00a0Mad at myself because unlike the food that I put into my body, I didn't take two seconds to check the chemicals that I let absorb into my skin and thus, into all of the organs of my body.\r\n\r\nI was mad at the manufacturers because they were using all kinds of preservatives that are known to cause hormone disruptors such as thyroid disease and Lupus and, a ton of others.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the toxic chemicals that you will want to avoid:\r\n<ul class=\"_kYe\">\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Parabens. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Synthetic colors. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Fragrance. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Phthalates. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Triclosan. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) \/ Sodium Laureth sulfate (SLES). ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Formaldehyde. ...<\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"_AXc\">Toluene.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThese are only ten of them, and if you go deep, you will see that the beauty industry is not pretty.\r\n\r\nI took all of my products and got rid of them. \u00a0However, I still needed a way to moisturize my skin.\r\n\r\nI am one of those people that want to use one or two products for some things, so this was when I decided to create my product called \"CoconutPods.\"\r\n\r\nI knew that there could be absolutely no chemicals or preservatives what so ever. \u00a0It had to be organic, and it had to moisturize quickly and effectively.\r\n\r\nAfter doing lots of testing, I found my formula which is just five natural and organic ingredients:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Organic Shea butter<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic Cocoa butter<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic Coconut Oil<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic and local Beeswax<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic essential oils.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nEverything is natural and won't throw your body off like traditional lotions and chemicals that are being sold to us without us knowing that many of them could be doing more harm than good.\r\n\r\nJust one CoconutPod (show picture or video below) a day from head to toe does the trick. \u00a0Most likely, you will even have some left and by all means, put it into your hair to soften and moisturize dry hair.\r\n\r\nNo bottles to carry. \u00a0No wasted product because you can't get it all out. \u00a0No chemicals that you have to worry about. \u00a0Just all natural moisturizer.\r\n\r\nIt's all about choices.\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong>What are

Ambien experience","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">My Ambien Experience<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo it's three in the morning, and as usual, I am wide awake.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't always like this. \u00a0I used to be able to sleep until I hit around age forty-five.\r\n\r\nThen came pre-menopause. \u00a0I got my hormones regulated and took Progesterone to help me sleep. \u00a0It helped for all of about one month.\r\n\r\nI drank wine and took Melatonin to get me to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen the wine, melatonin, and hormones no longer worked, I decided to pay my doctor a visit. \u00a0The hormone doctor wanted to keep increasing my hormones. \u00a0She told me to stop stressing, chill out, meditate. \u00a0Get my mind right. \u00a0Find out what it was that was keeping me up.\r\n\r\nI knew what was keeping me up; it was my effing brain that wouldn't shut the hell up. \u00a0It would remind me every morning, about this time and tell me about all of the things that I didn't do, needed to do and, what I could do better. \u00a0I couldn't stop it.\r\n\r\nIt was awful. \u00a0I would lay in bed staring at the ceiling for hours until I finally threw the covers off and got up. \u00a0Only to leave me tired and complaining to everyone the next day about how tired I was. \u00a0Then I would repeat the cycle every night.\r\n\r\nThe night would come, I would drink a couple of glasses of wine, pop my Melatonin, take my hormones and pray that I would not only get to sleep but stay a sleep for at least a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that I would wake up in the middle of the night from the alcohol.\r\n\r\n\"<b>Waking up<\/b> early after a late <b>night drinking<\/b> is common. After two drinks, <b>alcohol\u00a0<\/b>disrupts your sleep patterns. After <b>alcohol<\/b> is metabolized, adaptations your body made to adjust for its effects are now unnecessary, throwing your body out of whack and jolting you awake.\" (http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/why-wake-up-early-after-drinking-alcohol-2017-3)\r\n\r\nYep! \u00a0That was me. \u00a0I not only woke up from the alcohol, but I was also dehydrated as hell and felt like shit. \u00a0Now I had even more problems. \u00a0I was sleep deprived and hungover, and I was more awake than ever..\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">My Ambien Experience<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my Ambien experience.\r\n\r\nAfter giving my primary care doctor my entire sob story about how the quality of my life was diminished by my lack of sleep, thinking that I needed him to approve or justify why I needed drugs, he could give a shit, and in all of ten seconds, he wrote me a prescription for Ambien.\r\n\r\nHe gave me ten milligrams and told me to bite it in half at night. \u00a0One so that I could build up a tolerance and two so that I could get double the dose and save on my insurance co-payment.\r\n\r\nI took that prescription and went straight to my pharmacy where I told them that I, like an addict, needed my pills today!\r\n\r\nI got my Ambien and waited for dark. \u00a0I was eager to get started right away and fantasized about all of the time that I would have once I was able to sleep for eight hours.\r\n\r\nI wanted the quality of time that I once had like when I slept all day as a teenager. \u00a0I remember my mother opening my door on the weekends saying \"get up, you're going to sleep your life away.\"\r\n\r\nThose were the days when you could sleep all day until you force yourself to get your ass up. \u00a0Now, it's the opposite; I have to force my ass to stay in bed.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm paying the price later in life for sleeping all day, and now, I am being punished.\r\n\r\nI bit the pill in half, and within minutes, I felt like I had been put under anesthesia. \u00a0It was incredible. \u00a0I was out in no time. \u00a0I woke up and felt pretty darn good and thought that I had found my magic pill.\r\n\r\nUntil I built up a tolerance and they no longer worked. \u00a0Soon I was taking a whole pill and then one and a half. \u00a0I told myself that there was no way that I would graduate to taking two ten milligrams because then what?\r\n\r\nWas I addicted to Ambien? Is Ambien addictive?\r\n\r\n\"<b>Ambien<\/b> is in a class of drugs known as sedative-hypnotics. This non-benzodiazepine \u201cZ-drug\u201d has the same medical effectiveness as benzodiazepines like Xanax without the same hazardous and habit-forming properties those drugs are known for. ... Although it is not as habit-forming as benzos, <b>Ambien<\/b> is an addictive substance.\" (https:\/\/www.addictioncenter.com\/sleeping-pills\/ambien\/)\r\n\r\nI know addiction very well because my mother suffered horribly until her death with addiction and I had to be careful. \u00a0It's not that I thought I was addicted (I know that's what most people addicted say) but, I was more addicted to the nightly ritual ( I know again).\r\n\r\nI was reminded the next day from others about all of the things that I did the night before when I would take Ambien. \u00a0I had no recollection of any of it. \u00a0I would send odd and random text messages to my contact list, create Facebook posts that I was mortified about and would quickly delete the next day.\r\n\r\nThe worse was the sleep sex. \u00a0Of course, I wouldn't remember it but would quickly realize it when I would wake up naked the next day.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that I felt like I was losing my mind. \u00a0I was at a loss for words. \u00a0I couldn't remember shit. \u00a0I would read the same sentence over and over and not understand it.\r\n\r\nMy body felt like crap, and I wasn't myself anymore.\r\n\r\nI began to drink wine again and then pop the Ambien, Melatonin and try to sleep. \u00a0I felt even worse, and I created this loop that I lived in for several months.\r\n\r\nI remember sitting in my office feeling like my body was shutting down. \u00a0Worse than when I just didn't sleep.\r\n\r\nSo, I quit! I went home, threw away the bottle of pills and vowed to never take that shit again! And I didn't.\r\n\r\nCan I sleep now? \u00a0No. \u00a0But I do get a couple of hours here and there. \u00a0The best part is, I feel so much better and I appreciate what I took for granted before.\r\n\r\nThey say the older you get, the less sleep that you need because, the less time that you have left. \u00a0I think that whoever the hell said that was like me, up at three in the morning and decided that time is more valuable and sleep is overrated and, I'd rather walk around sleep deprived and complain about it than to walk around like an Ambien zombie

this!\u00a0 To reduce your cravings as you eliminate these, eat protein for breakfast like eggs, tofu scramble or a protein shake. \u00a0Use Stevia for sweetener.<\/em><\/strong><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2><em><strong>Tip #2<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div><em><strong>Always combine

four easy steps how to change the skin on your face, neck, chest, and hands completely.<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">I call it the Reverse, Repair, Regenerate, and Protect system.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">This system will get rid of texture issues, brown spots, fine lines, smooth out deep wrinkles and, more!<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">\"I believe it's as good as going to a cosmetic surgeon only you won't have to spend a ton of money or have a lot of downtime.\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">2. \u00a0I'll show you wh<\/strong><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">ere to get the products that you'll need for less than retail. \u00a0This alone will save y0u a ton of cash!<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">You will see amazing changes in two weeks and then it will progress from there. \u00a0It only gets better and better.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">** FYI - We're not talking about putting some cream on the top of your skin either. <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">We are talking wounding the skin in a controlled manner and then letting it do its natural thing by building collagen and then building upon that.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Before you do anything invasive like plastic surgery or lasers, try this program. I think you will be amazed at just how much your skin will change.<\/strong>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Is this quick mine course expensive?<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Nope! This course will save you money by helping you eliminate products that don't change the skin and putting in place a few products that will not only improve the \"appearance\" but will change your skin entirely!<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Who knows? \u00a0You may be spending more than you need to right now on products that don't work or aren't working like you hoped they would.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The money that will save from not having to go to a cosmetic surgeon or dermatologist could save you thousands of dollars.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201cThe information in this course is worth well over the $1000.00, but I\u2019m giving it for just $97.00. <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>That is the price of one failed product at the department store but without one-tenth of the results.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">\u201cWhy would you take my advice on this?<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">I want to look good for my age too and, I can't afford to spend thousands of dollars on lasers, peels, and products. So, I did my research, I tried hundreds of products and, I even wrote a book on it. I also blog about all of this stuff \u00a0 here at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/\">myagingandwellness.com<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.filepicker.io\/api\/file\/1Z7GcTn7Qwqy8oNHuMIT\" data-verified=\"redactor\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou see the thing is, I'm obsessed with anti-aging and looking as good as we can. Sure, I know we are all going to get old but, why not look as good as you can while doing it!\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">What I discovered is the key to having younger skin, and that is to slightly and gently wound the surface, let it heal so new skin can be made and then build upon this.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">The core of this course is to build and build new skin, and that's how we can get that fantastic youthful look.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">It doesn't matter what damage you have; you can improve upon it.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\"> I'm not going to tell you that you can make everything look like you were 25 again but, I will say that if you do this quick system, just five minutes in the morning, five minutes in the evening and five minutes every other week, your skin will change.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">How much? That depends on your body and your willingness to do these steps. That's it!<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">It's' easy to get started.

E serum from my links below and get started. \u00a0These are the exact products that create amazing results.<\/h4>\r\n<h4>When you get the Derma Roller you will start with a clean face, neck, and chest. \u00a0Take the Derma Roller and on a scale of one to ten, begin rolling with a pressure of about a three or so. \u00a0As you get used to it, you can add pressure.<\/h4>\r\n<h4>Step one:<\/h4>\r\n<h4>Start with your face then your neck and then, your chest. \u00a0Go at your own tolerance. \u00a0It will tingle or sting slightly but again, you can adjust the pressure as needed.<\/h4>\r\n<h4>Step two:<\/h4>\r\n<h4>After you have rolled your face, neck, and chest, use the Vitamin C &amp;

ACTIVITY AND AGING","content":"<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND AGING<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEngaging in physical activity does the body wonders.\u00a0 Basically when we exercise, every cell in our body benefits from it.\u00a0 Exercising lowers our blood pressure and makes our arteries stronger.\r\n\r\nIt also makes our bones stronger, our brains better and, helps our immune system, not to mention it helps maintain our weight goals as well.\u00a0 I workout daily although my motto is \u201cthe best part of working out is when it\u2019s done\u201d it does feel good to have done it.\r\n\r\nThree types of exercising and these are cardio, strength training and, yoga\/stretching.\u00a0 Of course, there are different types of programs such as, plyometrics, circuit training, high intensity interval training, Tabata, CrossFit, etc.\r\n\r\nThese all have value but cardio is the best overall.\u00a0 Of course, you get some cardio from weight training from strength training; it's is better to get your heart rate to seventy-five and eighty-five percent of its maximum capacity for at least 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis translates into about 120 beats a minute for the average person.\u00a0 If you like riding bikes, dancing or fast walking, these can also be beneficial as well.\u00a0 Of course cardio will burn lots of calories fast.\r\n\r\nLifting weights creates lean muscle mass.\u00a0 The more muscle mass we have the more growth hormone and other anti-aging combinations we will have.\u00a0 Not to mention we will look lean and toned which looks aesthetically pleasing to say the least.\r\n\r\nYoga and stretching improves mobility and flexibility as we age.\u00a0 It also helps improve strength and we need all of these as we age to prevent injury.\u00a0 Endorsing both the renewal process and the exercise process, you will endorse a better body both inside and out.\u00a0 You will also add years to your life.\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND AGING<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, exercising takes effort.\u00a0 A lot of people don\u2019t like to exercise or say they just don\u2019t have the time.\u00a0 If you absolutely hate to exercise, I say do the easiest one that way you will do it.\u00a0 Anything is better than nothing.\u00a0 Who knows, after a while, you may do more and more as you look and feel better.\u00a0 If you say you don\u2019t have time, then get up earlier or split your workout into two sessions.\r\n\r\nDo twenty minutes before your morning shower and twenty quickly before you eat dinner.\u00a0 You will be amazed how well this works and how fast it goes by breaking it up.\u00a0 If you think you will fail to eat right, workout and renew your body because maybe, you have failed many times before, I want you to know this is not some diet.\r\n\r\nLiving in the renewal process is simply the way our bodies want us to in order to optimize its longevity.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to do it in one big leap, just take your time.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier than we might think.\u00a0 Go easy at first and then the harder stuff will come easier too.\r\n\r\nTo the extent you take care of yourself is the extent that your body will return the favor.\u00a0 If you only follow a few of these steps, then so be it.\u00a0 At least you are taking care of yourself and you are becoming mindful of the process.\u00a0 When we become mindful and aware, we tend to automatically put it into our subconscious and it becomes a reflex and second nature.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:

How to turn on the Longevity gene","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\"Resveratrol\" How to turn on the Longevity gene<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The French Paradox\" which suggests that despite a high-fat diet and a high consumption of red wine had a low incidence of heart disease compared to Americans.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most researches agreed that the substance in wine offered the protection. \u00a0Even the American dietary guidelines changed their premise stating that moderate consumption of red wine is beneficial to our health. \u00a0Before you go out and drink a whole lot of red wine, keep reading on.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now scientists have identified the exact substance in red wine called Resveratrol\u00a0which they believe protects more than just our heart.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They are also stating that Resveratrol in high doses could significantly extend life and prevent a host of other age-related illnesses.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If they are right, we could all be taking a pill very soon to add a decade or two to our lives. If what they think to be correct about Resveratrol, then this may change health care as we know it!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This pill that we will take ( Resveratrol) could delay the inevitable. \u00a0It will prevent and forestall many of the diseases that come with age starting at age 50, 60, 70 and beyond.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's not a wonder drug that will turn a 90-year old into a 30-year-old, but it will slow the train down at whatever age you are at. \u00a0That in itself would have me running out to get it!<\/p>\r\nWe can slow down the death train if you will. \u00a0This is how it works. \u00a0In almost all life forms there is a SIRT1 Gene. It's ordinarily inactive within us, but when it's active,for it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Red wine is loaded with Resveratrol and found in the skin of the grapes. \u00a0The Resveratrol protects the skin of the grapes from fungus and bacteria.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another way to turn the longevity gene on is to \"stay hungry\" eating a lot of food turns the gene off and dieting (eating fewer calories) turns it on. \u00a0It's called calorie restriction.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking at monkeys in a controlled study, the monkeys that took in fewer calories than the second group who got to eat what they wanted, looked younger, had fewer health problems and lived longer than the \"chunky monkeys.\" \u00a0Pound for pound the lighter monkeys do much better.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A hungry life turns on our genetic survival switch and appears to lead to a longer life. So there is a survival advantage live on a calorie restrictive diet.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have to say that I am going to try this however, as I write this it's about lunch time for me and I'm starving just by thinking that I will restrict my calories but, it's worth it to try it as I like to do things that keep me healthy and not fad diets and supplements, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate. \u00a0I have created a six-step course called \"The Rejuvenation Program\" <\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>\u00a0You can check it out by clicking this link:\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com\/\">http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/> The Rejuvenation Program\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Before you go, I created \"The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\" In just seven<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><em>https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/em><\/a><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">how does Resveratol work<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to live longer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">resveratrol<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">supplements<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the longevity gene<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the SIRT1 Gene<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/16498926_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":7380,"slug":"do-you-need-natural-hormone-replacement","type":"post","title":"Do you need natural hormone replacement?","content":"<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Do you need natural hormone replacement?<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Does natural hormone replacement have the ability to keep us youthful and disease free for life?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormones are substances naturally produced by components of the endocrine gland, ovaries, testicles, pituitary, pineal gland, \u00a0and thyroid. \u00a0Levels change and influence the aging process.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormone replacement can turn back the clock if the levels are stabilized which gives us leverage in our bid for anti-aging.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormones are different from vitamins and minerals because hormones regulate the metabolic activity in our bodies. \u00a0While vitamins and minerals do the rest of the work. Hormones make all the big decisions in our bodies, and they are effective in small numbers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Correcting hormone deficiencies can play a huge role in our health and our longevity. The key is to detect and correct hormones successfully. \u00a0Hormones can reverse many of the mental and physical changes that we see as normal aging.<\/p>\r\nFor example, hormone replacement therapy can help with the immune system, brittle bones, muscles loss, memory, insomnia, fatigue, loss of libido, and a lot more.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormones help the body become healthier and heal faster so that we can live a better life and live a longer life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When they say \"hormone replacement\" they don't mean that all of a sudden you no longer have any hormones circulating through your blood. \u00a0What is meant is that our bodies are making fewer hormones as we age. \u00a0In our thirties, the decline begins to take place.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Did you know that the gradual deterioration in hormone reduction is already programmed in our genes? As hormones slow down, aging speeds up. \u00a0The rate of reduction usually equals the rate of aging.<\/p>\r\nHere are the hormones I'm talking about:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Melatonin<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone<\/li>\r\n \t<li>DHEA<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Pregnenolone<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Thyroid<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we restore these hormones, hopefully at the level of when we were younger, we can slow down or dare I say it \"<strong>reverse the aging process<\/strong>?\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each type of hormone is specific. \u00a0Currently, I am on a small dose of estrogen, a testosterone cream, melatonin, and thyroid hormone. \u00a0Do I feel great? \u00a0I'd like to think so. I'm pushing fifty in a couple of months so, yes, I would want to reverse or at the very least, keep disease away.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the next post, I will break down the above five hormones and how they work. \u00a0I will also tell you how you can get tested and what synthetic hormones there are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Until then, I will ask you. \u00a0Have you ever had your hormones tested?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check out my free \"2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula\" It's the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!

Premature ventricular contractions are premature because they occur before the regular heartbeat.\"\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I found this out because I was going to have a minor cosmetic procedure and the doctor did an EKG, and it came back abnormal. \u00a0She said that she wouldn't do the procedure until I got a heart doctor to clear me.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, after thousands of dollars to satisfy my deductible, I had a stress test, a heart halter monitor, more EKG's, a Nuclear heart test (radio active dye put in my veins), and an echocardiogram, and a few other tests.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I went' to my \"Natural OBGYN\" to tell her that every since she put me on thyroid medicine, I could feel my heart palpitating. \u00a0She took blood, I went back and she said, it was not the thyroid medicine but that my heart issue was just part of aging.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With sadness, I took her words and thankfully\u00a0my heart came back normal. \u00a0I got my clearance from the heart doctor and I got my procedure.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the next year or so, I went back four times to tell my OBGYN that there was something wrong with my heart. \u00a0She couldn't find anything.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I decided to get another opinion and went to an Endocrinologist and he said that I should stay on the thyroid medicine because he said my blood level was normal and now found a nodule on my thyroid meaning, my thyroid was attacking itself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I Got the nodule tested and it too was fine.\u00a0So, I took more thyroid medicine. I felt like I was on diet pills, my heart felt like it was jumping out of my chest and, I felt bad all of the time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was close to accepting living this way. \u00a0Until, I needed another minor surgery and the anesthesiologist decided to give me yet, another EKG because, by now I was on blood pressure medication because of my heart rate and, my PVC'S were twice as bad as the time before.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She said she would not put me under and said again that I needed heart clearance. They pulled the I'V'S out and after losing my payment to secure the surgery, I was again, spinning trying to figure out what to do next.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After getting dressed and being kindly told not to come back until I could figure out my health issue, I sadly walked to my car.<\/p>\r\nI called my OBGYN in the parking lot and she said to come right over and get my thyroid tested. \u00a0By now, I was tired of playing this game. \u00a0I decided she was the problem and that I needed to find a way to get off of thyroid medication. \u00a0She actually wanted me to take more as she said I was even on the low end!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I almost cried because I thought for a second that maybe my heart was failing and my life would end up being short. \u00a0I recently lost my brother to the side effects of radiation near his heart and I concluded that I would be next.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After all, I am going to be 50 in a couple of months and they say that heart disease is the number one killer of women over 50. \u00a0I thought it was just my fate and I was going to have to live with a bad heart valve or something.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I did get another blood test and took it to a new endocrinologist. \u00a0He said as soon as I told him the symptoms and what I was taking, he told me the problem was the name brand \"Armour\" and that it was made from pigs and that, sometimes we can't handle pig thyroid.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said in some people it causes an electrical arrhythmia. \u00a0He might as well have said, \"Theresa, your hell is over and you've been saved.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, I'm 90% Vegan which goes against me taking pig medicine but I'm also 100% proactive in my health and I know my body.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doctor also said that, every dose is a different dose meaning that, it comes from different pigs so my body has an issue with it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don't know how many times I asked my \"Natural OBGYN\" to think about switching my brand. \u00a0Nope! She knew best because she was \"the doctor.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Long story short (okay I'm making it short because you're probably tired of this already), the new endocrinologist took me off of Armour thyroid medicine and eight weeks later my blood tests show I don't or maybe never needed thyroid medication it in the first place!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My heart rhythm is back to normal and I don't feel like I'm ready to jump off a cliff!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I won't get back all of the money and time that I lost over this and I swear being over medicated aged me but, it's better late than never to save myself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The take away here is: \u00a0If you know your body and it's telling you that the doctors are not right then listen to yourself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No doctor will take care of you like you and, get lot's opinions until you get the right answers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While my heart was being damaged, my \"Natural OBGYN\" was ranting about how she's opening her seventh natural\u00a0anti-aging clinic. \u00a0I kindly said, maybe you should work on your first one!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think I will re-think natural aging from now on.\u00a0What's up with doctors these days?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate. \u00a0I have created a six-step course called \"The Rejuvenation Program\" <\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>\u00a0You can check it out by clicking this link:\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com\/\">http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/> The Rejuvenation Program\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">heart issues<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">irregular heartbeats<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">premature ventricular contractions<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">pvc's<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">taking the wrong medicine<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">thyroid disease<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/42307253_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":7331,"slug":"i-love-goodrx-com-heres-why-2","type":"post","title":"I love GoodRx.com!!

If you read this blog, you probably know that I write fifty-percent about health issues and the other half about anti-aging and, aging issues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I've also written a book about \"The secret to getting products and procedures cheap\" and in it, I tell you how to get these for less than retail. \u00a0In one chapter (the products) I write about how I found Retin-A online at Canadapharmacy.com and, up until yesterday, that was my go-to place to get it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don't know what Retin-A is, I will give you a quick explanation and move on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What is Retin-A?\u00a0Retin-A (tretinoin) is a form of vitamin A that helps the skin renew itself and is used\u00a0to reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and mottled skin discoloration, and to make rough facial skin feel smoother.\" (http:\/\/www.drugs.com\/retin-a.html)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn't agree more with the statement above as I have been using Retin-A for about twenty years and it has really changed my skin. \u00a0That said, you can't get it without a prescription and even worse, most (if not all) insurance plans don't cover it because of its cosmetic use.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So until I found canadapharmacy.com, I was paying retail about $275.00 for a tube of Retin-A that only lasted me about six weeks (if that).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's be real here, I'm turning 50 next month, and I've seriously done some sun damage, and I need this stuff everywhere! \u00a0I can't be skimping on a product that works because of its price! \u00a0With canadapharmacy.com I paid about $95.00, and I was happy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The downside was that I had to wait a few weeks for them to mail it but, so long as I ordered it before running out of what I had, I was good. \u00a0But that's the thing, I didn't always stay on top of it, and I ended up having to pay retail a lot just to use Retin-A consistently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now is where GoodRx.com comes in! \u00a0I came across their website by accident, and on their website, they have a search bar, and I put the name Retin-A in, and they came back with prices of five or so pharmacy's in my area with competing prices!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I almost fell out of my chair because not only was the price $50.00 at CVS but, the tube size was double! \u00a0I thought this was too good to be true. \u00a0You know, the old bait and switch thing?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I figured I didn't have anything to lose and I downloaded the coupon on my phone, took my prescription to CVS, they scanned the coupon on my phone and, done!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pharmacy clerk told me these sweet words \"$50.00, and it will be ready in fifteen minutes!\" \u00a0I stood there like I had won something or that I needed to feel guilty because I was kind of ripping them off somehow.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dumb way to think right? \u00a0Since the drug companies rip-off us consumers but, that is another blog post, and I won't let my ADHD kick in right now!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn't believe it! \u00a0I happen to have another prescription for skin bleach (you know to lighten all the sun damage on my legs too!), and the clerk downloaded another coupon for me from GoodRx.com and, the cost was $20.00! \u00a0I have been paying 69.00 dollars for the same product!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Long story short ( I know, none of my stories are short), if you have any prescription, covered by insurance or not, run it through GoodRx.com and check out the cash\/coupon price of competing pharmacies. \u00a0You just might be surprised at how much money you will save.<\/p>\nI figure I'm saving a couple\u00a0of hundred dollars a month to do what I want wi.

Do what makes you happy while you still can.<\/p>\r\nBack to my initial topic of \"there's no place for old people.\" \u00a0Sorry, my ADHD kicks in quite often!! \u00a0Actually, about every five seconds and it's only getting worse as I age.. But it's also my gift as well as my curse.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Okay, now what was I talking about? Oh yeah!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They say the older you get the faster you get older. \u00a0I know what this means because the last ten to twenty years have flown by. \u00a0Each day flies by in fact, and I watch the clock and instead of when I was younger, wanting the time to go by as fast as possible, I watch the clock as my heart sinks and I fear that another day is about to end. I hate how fast time is going but, I have no control over time. We're all going to get old whether we like it or not.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm getting older and if life goes faster now that I'm older then how much longer do I have, I wonder? \u00a0Right now I still look reasonably okay and I am able to do anything physically. \u00a0The real worry is when, I get to that age where I'm really old and when people look past me. \u00a0Like being invisible. Which is not very far away even if I still feel and act like I'm eighteen!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Society loves youth and society rewards youth and, probably like most others, I feel like I didn't appreciate my youth when I had it. \u00a0With that said, I like most people, did the best I could with what I had, and for that, I am grateful for who I am today.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I could sum up what I'm trying to say here is just read the lyrics the Baz Luhrmann, Wear Sunscreen song below.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth\r\nOh, never mind\u00a0You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded\u00a0But trust me, in 20 years you\u2019ll look back at photos of yourself\r\nAnd recall in a way you can\u2019t grasp now\u00a0How much possibility lay before you\r\nAnd how fabulous you really looked\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don\u2019t worry about the future\r\nOr worry\u00a0But know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum\u00a0The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind\u00a0The kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some idle Tuesday\r\nDo one thing everyday that scares you.\"<\/p>\r\n\"Don\u2019t be reckless with other people\u2019s hearts\u00a0Don\u2019t put up with people who are reckless with yours.\"\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don\u2019t waste your time on jealousy\u00a0Sometimes you\u2019re ahead, sometimes you\u2019re behind\r\nThe race is long\u00a0And in the end, it\u2019s only with yourself.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults.\u00a0If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don't know about you but, I think those are some pretty powerful lyrics and you pretty much have to be older to appreciate them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I feel like I have some time to do the things that I want and to love the people who are in my life and, who I know \u00a0will naturally leave me sooner than I hope.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe that's the key to getting old. \u00a0We become fulfilled with the love that we give and the things we did while we are here. \u00a0Once you can or have done this, you can begin to step back and let others have the space that you once had.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe its not looking at others like they're taking your space at all but, it's just the natural form of energy that we as old people have to transfer so that energy can re-circulate so that, the younger generation can have it to use.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whatever the rest of my days will bring me and no matter how fast they come, I will remember that, \u00a0I got to live an incredible life because it was my life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if didn't create some huge powerful company, an app that changed the world or, I wasn't the most beautiful woman in the world, I had the opportunity to grow old and for some, they don't even get that chance.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All that will matter in the space and time I have left is that I was born, born free, I created some beautiful kids and I was nice, giving, loving and compassionate towards others.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I guess the whole point to this blog post is not so much about \"there's no place for old people\" but about \"reflection is the greatest gift an old person can give themself.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here's to our place :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">*Since writing this post, my mom passed away..

\u00a0Couldn't the bad news wait until the morning when I could handle bad news better? \u00a0But then, I realized how selfish that would be if I did wait and how unfair it would be for the person on the other side making the call.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I got out of bed, got my phone and went into the living room. \u00a0It was my brother, and in a sad and raspy voice he told me that our mother had passed away on her living room couch all alone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earlier in the day, he and our mother had gotten into an argument (which was happening more often between them) and that he had storm out the door. \u00a0When he returned that night, he saw her laying on the couch but the weird thing was that, she was laying in the same position for seven hours. \u00a0He said when he saw her he knew that she had passed away.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I told him to call 911 and go outside and that I would come over. \u00a0I sat silently in my living room for two hours just wondering if I really wanted to rush over to my mothers house and see her dead on her couch. \u00a0I just didn't think I could handle seeing her laying there and I certainly didn't want that to be my last memory.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, something came over me and I took a shower, got ready and made the forty-five minute drive to her house.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I drove up and saw the police outside as the EMS had already left. \u00a0I knew there was only one person we were waiting for and that was the coroner. \u00a0As I got out of my car and talked to the police, I watched my brother pacing on the front lawn. \u00a0I hugged him and he said, \"Terry, if you want to see her, you can look through the living room windows and see her laying on the couch.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">His words felt like a knife piercing my heart. \u00a0Did I really want to see her or did I want to remember the last time I saw her? \u00a0I didn't want to remember so much the last time I saw her because it was the Thursday before and it didn't go so well.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I went to her house to visit and she looked horrible. \u00a0Her clothes looked ratty, she smelled like cigarettes and she only weighed about seventy-five pounds. She just looked awful and I wasn't going to have it!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I grabbed my moms arm and told her to sit down. \u00a0I scolded her about her appearance and begged her to tell me what was going on with her. \u00a0She assured me that she didn't know why she was losing so much weight and that she was eating but she just didn't feel well.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I told her that if she didn't start eating and taking care of herself that I would call a Social Worker and have them come over and do whatever was necessary to find out what was really going on with her. \u00a0I gave her some new clothes and I told her that she should put on some makeup, fresh clothes and start taking care of herself. \u00a0I told her that the next time I saw her, I didn't want to see her like she was then.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I saw the pain in her eyes and I also knew in my heart that her spirit way dying. \u00a0She was dying. \u00a0It broke my heart and I just couldn't add to her pain. \u00a0After all, I'm the one who has tried to save her for most of her life. My mother eyes told everything and right there they were telling me that she was more like my child.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I said \"mom, I'm not here to be mean to you. \u00a0I just want you to be okay. \u00a0I want you to be happy. \u00a0I don't like to see you this way.\" \u00a0She said to me that she didn't think I was being mean but that, I loved her and that I cared about her. \u00a0That made me happy and we sat and talked for a bit. \u00a0Now I wish it had been longer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her words comfort me every time I doubt myself and think that I could have done something more to save her.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know they say you don't know how strong you are until you have to be and man that is so true. \u00a0I lost my younger brother two years ago and I think this is when my mom gave up. \u00a0In a short time after my brother died, she lost the only man that loved her and my other brother developed a brain tumor. \u00a0I think some people are just not as strong as others and in my mothers case, she was probably born a very weak soul.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not to say that if you lose a child it shouldn't weaken you because I never ever want to find this out and, I could only imagine how much will it takes to pull yourself out of a dark hole and try to move on.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother lived in a dark hole and she could never pull herself out. \u00a0The good times didn't last for long for her, when they came, she worried about how long they would last. \u00a0She never lived in the moment, ever.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Today I picked up my mothers ashes. \u00a0They gave me her final belongings which was a cross and a St. Christoper that she wore around her neck to keep her safe and so that God would know that she was afraid of dying.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I thought that picking up her ashes would affect me worse than it did but, it was more of a feeling of peace. \u00a0I knew the ashes were not her and that she was now free.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It feels comforting to me knowing how much spiritual pain that my mother was in that now her body is strong, her mind is free and her soul is happy for once. \u00a0Although I rarely saw this, I remember her last words were, \"and I love you.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Someone asked my if I think it was harder to lose my mother in a sudden passing as compared to losing her to cancer and watching her suffer or die slowly and I told them that, I watched my mom die my whole life. \u00a0And, it will always haunt me to know or think that her only daughter couldn't save her from herself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don't want to ever minimize the way anyone dies because when you lose someone you love it hurts deep no matter what the circumstance is. \u00a0When you watch someone in pain, no matter what kind of pain it's agonizing. \u00a0I have learned that it's also a blessing to allow them to be free and to appreciate that they are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Christmas Eve, like I had done for so many years before, I picked up my cell phone and dialed her number to tell her Merry Christmas but, as the phone rang, I realized that she was gone and that I would never talk to her again. \u00a0I will never see her again and I will never get to hug her frail little body ever again. \u00a0I put my phone down and cried in a Walgreen's parking lot.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother died of an accidental drug over dose by using Methadone. \u00a0I know it wasn't exactly intentional because while saying my final good bye to her on the couch, I noticed that she had her done, she put on makeup and was wearing the new clothes that I bought her.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She listened to me that day when I told her the next time I saw her that I didn't want to see her the way she was and she was all made up. \u00a0Maybe she knew where she was going or maybe she wanted to look nice for me, that I'll never know.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My question or wonder is, is it suicide when you don't intend to kill yourself but you use drugs? \u00a0I don't know but, if you use drugs to escape then you are already committing spiritual suicide because you don't feel comfortable in your own body and for that, her intentions are what they are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rest in peace my sweet dear mother. \u00a0I know you tried and I know that you're in heaven and your with your son and, I know most of all that you loved me as best as you could. I'll see you again one day and on that day we won't have to worry about the elephant that was always in the room. \u00a0We can celebrate together.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Goodbye Momma you're free now..<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">*The picture on this blog post is of the time when my mom was happy for a minute. \u00a0I took her back to where she grew up. \u00a0This is how I will remember her..

menopause","content":"<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Don't fear menopause<\/span><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember going to my yearly OBGYN appointment and sitting across from my doctor.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She had my most recent blood tests laid across\u00a0her desk, and we were about to go over them. \u00a0As we went down the list, she said: \"And this one shows that you are in the beginning stages of menopause.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What she said for the next fifteen minutes after that, I do not know. \u00a0I was numb. \u00a0I could feel my heart sink and I wanted to cry.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can't possibly be going into menopause. \u00a0I was never supposed to get old. \u00a0When I was young, I said I never would! \u00a0What the hell!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I was feeling was that I had lost my youth and I was now an old lady. \u00a0How did I get here and now what?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, let me say that I've been incredibly fortunate to get to be old because many never get the opportunity to get old but damn, did it have to come so fast and damn, I better not fall apart!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After leaving my doctor's office, I called everyone that I knew and told them the news \"I'm in menopause (like it was some awful diagnosis and my time was ticking away) and it didn't seem to phase anyone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I got stories back like, \"Oh yeah? \u00a0I've been for several years now. \u00a0Or, welcome to the next part of your life.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I drove home and contemplated what my next step would be (like I had no choices left in life or something).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One month after the blood test report, I went back to my doctor and told her that I was ready to fight! \u00a0I wanted to stimulate my ovaries and keep my body as young as possible.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was when the real trouble began because trying to regulate your hormones is challenging. \u00a0 I\u00a0asked for Bio-identical hormones, and then one led to the next and the next, and they just kept coming.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had long cycles, missed cycles, sleep issues, mood changes and other problems that weren't the nicest, to say the least.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was 48 years old then. \u00a0Now I am going to be 51 next month, and I think I have a handle on menopause and I am accepting of getting old. \u00a0In fact, I have a whole new outlook on the next chapter of my life.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Don't fear menopause and here's why<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7525\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/meandbrandi-2-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" \/><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back in the day when our mothers went through menopause, they either had to suffer through the symptoms or take synthetic hormones that caused more harm than good.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember how miserable my mom was. \u00a0Not only the physical symptoms were bad, but back in the day, they didn't have the resources and opportunities that we have today.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that I have almost completed my menopause\u00a0and have my bio-identical hormones stable, I can concentrate on things like living life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Life is almost better now. \u00a0I miss my kids, and I wish that they didn't have to grow up so fast but, they have moved out and my husband and I have the house to ourselves.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's amazing. \u00a0I don't have to clean up, chase after anyone, spend my money or do anything other than what I want to do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can often travel, which I do. \u00a0I can buy whatever I want for me. \u00a0I can do the things that I've put off while raising a family and, life seems much more meaningful at the same time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, there are tradeoffs like losing my appearance, declining muscle tone, losing memory and, knowing that my health may decline.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, I always knew that the day would come where I would look into the mirror and see my aging self. \u00a0Not that I don't fight it! \u00a0I can because I have money now and if I wanted to get some work done, I would. \u00a0For now, I will wait.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">About losing my once perfectly toned body, well, I work out to keep what I can, and that's all I can do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will not let my health decline because I don't have to. \u00a0With technology and a clean diet, I can avoid many of the diseases that come along with aging.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are emotional issues that accompany menopause as I have seen it first hand with women I know and these are depression, anxiety, and a few others. \u00a0Not to diminish any of these, however, if you have these issues now, please do something for yourself and seek help. \u00a0There are so many treatments that will help you. \u00a0There is absolutely no reason to suffer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also believe that many of the emotional issues that come with menopause are because we haven't yet accepted that our roles have changed and that we are not needed like we once were by others.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes we don't let go of the past and then we get stuck in a sort of mourning place. \u00a0Although it may not be easy to move on, we have to. \u00a0We had to move on from being a baby, a child, a teen and now it's time to move into probably the best part of our lives. \u00a0We cannot stop what must be.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The biggest thing that I see that causes emotional and spiritual pain at middle age is when we have nothing going for ourselves. \u00a0No hobby, no interests, or anything. \u00a0This is the time that we need to find our joy, our voice, our peace for our next chapter.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now is the time of our lives. \u00a0No more menstrual cycles to deal with\u00a0anymore. \u00a0No more raising kids. \u00a0No more having to put everyone else ahead of our needs. \u00a0IT'S OUR TIME!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don't fear menopause because I believe this will be the absolute best time of your life if you accept it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enjoy because by now you can appreciate how fast time goes by.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Just a quick note. \u00a0I

can search the internet and find cosmetic surgeons and, you'll get a long list of doctors but, how do you know if they're any good and, how do you know about their past mistakes?\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">The truth is, many of the lists that are online are paid ads. \u00a0The reviews are usually the good ones, and the good ones are most commonly promoted by yet again, paid ads.<\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">If a doctor has made mistakes and they get a bad review, these reviews are usually pushed so far down that you typically don't see them.<\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">Are there excellent cosmetic surgeons that you can find online? \u00a0Of course, there are but, how do you know?<\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">The answer is, you don't know who will be operating on you from an internet search or another type of ad. \u00a0So, it's up to you to do enough research to feel as sure as you possibly can before going under the knife.<\/div>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><\/h2>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<h2 id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1491411699682_5167\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align:

who specializes in the type of procedure that you want. \u00a0The face and the body are very different and I think it takes a skilled hand to be able to work on a face.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Ask where they perform surgery, and find out that facility\u2019s level of accreditation. Look for AAAASF, AAAHC or JCAHO operating facility certification.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\"Ask about the anesthetist\u2019s qualifications.

Gravity will take over no matter if we get fillers of not.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">\u00a0Side effects of facial fillers or the<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"> \"Liquid Facelift\"<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe question is, do fillers increase the time that our skin will sag before it was supposed to by stretching out the skin to make it look fuller?\r\n\r\nThe previous question is a catch-22 because, if we are getting fillers in the first place, then we are already having issues with the way that we perceive\u00a0how we look and the gamble to stretch out our skin later is an even exchange for what we want at that moment.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of like getting a tan. \u00a0You know later you might pay for it but, at the moment it looks good now.\r\n\r\nI think the question becomes or the answer is if we \"need\" fillers (not before we do) then it's going to be a delicate balance between not over doing fillers and maintaining healthy skin moreover, a natural look.\r\n\r\nThen there is the other side effect or the mental side effect of fillers, and that is what I call \"filler regret.\"\r\n\r\nIt's when you get filler for the first time, and you get just the right amount, and you look pretty good and then you do more and more because of the way you looked or felt the first time that you got it. \u00a0Naturally, many of us think that more is better.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's because when you get your first filler you are the youngest, you'll ever be and as you get more filler to try and reduce the signs of aging, you convince yourself or your injector that you need more.\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">We are going to age no matter what. \u00a0Just ask the people with all the money in the world!<\/span><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo filler will ever stop the aging process and with that process, filler or no filler, gravity is going to take over, and you will look older and sometimes when getting older, the filler can make you look even older and sometimes, even, I hate to say this but, a little hideous.\r\n\r\nI won't say her name but she is an actress, and she did an interview in a magazine about how she regretted doing fillers and over time how they not only made her look older but made her depressed about how she looked.\r\n\r\nThe magazine showed before and after pictures and just as I stated already; initially, she got fillers in her early 40's and kept going into her early 50's (she's 56 now) and fillers could no longer keep up with gravity.\r\n\r\nHer face kept getting bigger and puffy and she no longer had any of the facial features that she once had.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, getting a little bit of filler to balance out your face when there is lost volume can be a good thing. \u00a0Just be realistic and do it sparingly because it won't take the place of a good cosmetic surgeon or being okay with aging itself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Just a quick note. \u00a0I am putting my affiliate links to two products that I swear by below. \u00a0Vitamin C &amp;

I too have gained my share of weight especially in the last eight to ten years.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, I can chalk it up to getting older or that my hormones are out of wack but, I am putting more food into my mouth and not moving like I once did, and this is the real reason that I am gaining weight.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also drink a lot of wine as I have gotten older and I know that alcohol has a lot of empty calories and, stopping drinking would not only help me to lose weight but improve my overall health.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also eat a lot when I'm bored or stressed. \u00a0I reach for food to keep my hands busy while I'm trying to figure out the task at hand and even worse, I eat just out of habit and when I'm not even hungry.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I've tried using the excuse of \"I don't eat that much, why am I gaining weight?\" but in reality,\u00a0drop me on an island alone, and the weight would melt off like butter!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But that's just the thing here. \u00a0Food is comforting. \u00a0I love carbs just as much as the next woman.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being that I am a social observer by nature (not to confuse a social judge because I don't think they are even remotely the same). I like to ask questions to perfect strangers, and I like to observe people so that I can figure out issues and then write about their pain points.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have noticed that a lot of us use food as a comfort mechanism. \u00a0Some of my friends are in denial, and some say that they don't care, but in the end, food seems to be an issue that if we don't make peace with, the emotional part of weight gain will only drag us down.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What do I see happening? \u00a0Well, besides the health ramifications of being overweight, there is the emotional part too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, at times I tend to be a bit superficial\u00a0by talking about things like being overweight; however, I think that for women, it's painful not to fit into the clothes that they once did and to look in the mirror and not like what they see.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I go out with my daughter of twenty-six, and she is small and petite like I once was, and I love the way she looks. \u00a0I also ask myself often why I needed to jump four sizes in twenty years too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My husband says \"it's because I'm not twenty and who wants to be?\" \u00a0Bless his heart he is very supportive. \u00a0But for me, I'm bothered by not fitting into my clothes and more so of the thought of moving up a size or two each decade.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I see some of my friends do what I call \"the great cover-up.\" \u00a0They wear big oversized shirts that cover themselves so that they don't have to see the weight but, they know it's there because they talk about it and how much they need to lose it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They use phrases like \"when I was younger\" \u00a0\"when I was skinny\" \u00a0\"when I lose this weight.\" \u00a0I can understand their pain. \u00a0But, when is the time?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Weight affects our happiness. \u00a0If you've gained a lot of weight, you may not want to have sex with your partner.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may stop doing the social things that you once did when you were younger.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carrying extra weight is emotionally and spiritually painful, and yet, we get to a place where we don't know how to get back to who we once were.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So we live with it because there is always tomorrow or worse, we have come to think that not being overweight is no longer an option and that, it comes with getting older.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shame is something that a lot of us women feel when we are overweight. \u00a0I'm not saying that we need to be ashamed of ourselves about anything and especially for being overweight.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I am saying is that many of us who hide our fat feel somewhat ashamed of it. \u00a0It's not your fault, and there is no reason to feel ashamed of anything. \u00a0When we are ready, we will make a change, but we have to decide to do it too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0I am writing to those of us who feel unhappy with the way we feel because time went by, life moved on and then one day, we realize that we don't feel as confident and happy as we once were.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course we are getting older, and of course, we will put on a little weight because our metabolism is, in fact, slowing down but, we can't use it as an excuse.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0Losing weight is hard, very hard. \u00a0Why is it hard? \u00a0Because it's about changing our mindset. \u00a0Not about spending our lives at the gym or dieting.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>Changing your mindset will set your body free.<\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why do we let ourselves gain weight as we age?<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's take a look at how being overweight and changing our mindset is related. \u00a0I already said that I eat when I am bored or stressed and even out of pure habit.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure I could become mindful and stop eating when I'm bored, stressed or whatever but, that's not the same as changing my mindset.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What matters here is changing the real issues and not just the symptoms of why I overeat.<\/p>\r\nFor example, you may overeat and when you do your brain rewards you and releases pleasure chemicals ingo to the same way as drugs and alcohol do.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know when I'm stressego-tofood is potatoes of any kind! \u00a0Man does it feel good.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But the truth is, I suffer from anxiety. \u00a0It's in my DNA. \u00a0I was born anxious. My mom died from it; my brothers have it, and I hate to say that, I have even passed the gene down.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With that, I know why I eat too much and drink too much wine. \u00a0The thing is, what I do about it that will ultimately cure my weight issue.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An issue that's not the real problem but only the symptom of my anxiety.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is it that causes you to overeat or use comfort food as an escape? \u00a0If you can take some time to step back to see what the triggers are that make you want to overeat or eat foods that are not healthy, then you can change your mindset.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, I warn you. \u00a0You will have to go deep. \u00a0You'll have to admit to yourself that there is something undone, lacking or that possibly you are unhappy about a situation or situations in your life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, you will have to change them, and this is the part that will either keep you overeating or not. \u00a0Once you do this, you will never have to talk about weight issues again.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure you'll have the few pounds that you'll probably always think that you need to lose but the real weight, the weight that carries all of the pain will\u00a0be gone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It won't be easy at first, and you may slip into old habits of saying that it's just your metabolism or getting older and that, you have no control.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But honestly, you do, and you can have a healthy body if you rid yourself of negative mindsets that have become vicious circles in your life.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Why do we let ourselves gain weight as we age?<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The weight that we carry is not about the food that we eat but instead the emotions that we tie to food. \u00a0I know I am not saying anything new here, but when we get this message then we get it! \u00a0I mean really.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I used to stand in front of the pantry in sheer boredom grazing at everything that I could take a bite of and before long, I was eating thousands of calories mindlessly. \u00a0It kept my mind busy so that I didn't have to do the things that had I needed to get done or so I could escape the things that I could not change in my life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It kept my mind busy so that I didn't have to do the things that had I needed to get done or so I could escape the things that I could not change in my life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For me, I finally gave in to my anxiety issue, and I have learned to forgive myself for something that is beyond my control, and I learned to see it as a blessing. \u00a0I am a sensitive soul, and I guess that's not so bad.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each time I feel the sensation of anxiety coming upon me, instead of reaching for something to consume to take away the feeling, I just sit still, breathe deep and then let it pass. \u00a0I try to only eat when I am hungry and not when I need to fill my emotions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, I try to only eat when I am hungry and not when I need to fill my emotions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wish the same for you :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/2016\/10\/02\/let-get-fat-age\/mepicture-4\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1395\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1395\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/mepicture-278x280.jpg\" alt=\"mepicture\" width=\"261\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving yourself!

Heck, I wasn't to be happy and not miserable! Frankly, I like eating, and I like having a full life. \u00a0Thank you very much.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0I have never been sold on living a rigid life as in detoxing or starving myself. Did you know that you don't even have to detox your body?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, \u00a0allowing our bodies not to have to work so hard by taking a break from meat and chemicals and, finding daily peace to reconnect outside of the busy world that we live in is a whole different thing. \u00a0It's called <strong>rejuvenation<\/strong> instead of the rigidness of <em>detoxing<\/em>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0Honestly, it's pretty easy to rejuvenate and what I have found through my research is that we don't need to detox so much as we need to steer clear of daily things that harm our body, mind, and soul.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008080;\">HOW TO REJUVENATE<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Truth be known, if we have to make ourselves detox, then we probably shouldn't be doing what needs to be detoxed in the first place. \u00a0This is the part of detox that I believe in.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don't worry; I'm not going to go into how you should take a holistic journey so that I can convince you to cross over into the world of meditation, yoga, and veganism. \u00a0Although if you do this or learn to, it's a pretty amazing feeling.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I believe that there are many ways to a path of contentment and mine is writing, contemplating and cooking. \u00a0Just like there are many different religions, one way doesn't fit everyone and for that, finding what makes your spirit connected is your meditation and yoga.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your body doesn't need for you to do anything drastic to keep it running smoothly. \u00a0The idea of drinking a tonic of green veggies and then washing away all of the bad that we have done to it is only a myth.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just a made up term used by marketers so that they can scare you and then sell you the \"<strong>detox cure<\/strong>.\" \u00a0It's not true. \u00a0There is no such cure because you don't need it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me clarify something while I'm on the subject. \u00a0There are detox programs that are beneficial, and that is for alcohol, smoking, and drugs. \u00a0But, for now, we are merely talking about our everyday lives of overeating, over consuming and overusing chemicals.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your body is healthy, you already have the perfect detoxification systems, and that is your liver and kidneys. \u00a0Our body is so remarkable at healing itself that it does this even in the worst conditions, even when we inflict bad daily habits.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So rather than try and convince you that you need to take drastic measures to detoxify your body, I'm going to state the fact that our bodies already do this and us going to the extremes of punishing ourselves to feel <em>psychologically<\/em> better about doing so, is not the answer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>I'm going to propose a different scenario, and that is rather than \"detox\" one should \"rejuvenate.\"<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You might be asking yourself what is the difference between detox and rejuvenation?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They sound like the same thing right?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer is that detox is an extreme measure that has no validation other than in the marketing and the entrepreneurial world.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, let's be real here. \u00a0Rejuvenation is about a lifestyle. \u00a0A way to reverse disease, turn back the clock, feel more energetic and extend your lifespan.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rejuvenation is the ultimate detox because it is living a life of rejuvenation and that is healthy living, living in moderation and exercising. \u00a0Of course, this means not smoking, not over drinking and eating a healthy diet.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Mediterranean diet comes to mind which is characterized especially by high consumption of vegetables and olive oil and moderate consumption of protein.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Vegetarian or Vegan diet is also fantastic. \u00a0( I know that I said I wasn't trying to get you to become for a Vegan, but it's a good plan if you wanted to. \u00a0Just saying :) )<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For myself, I eat a vegan diet of 60% vegetables, 20% protein and about 20% healthy carbohydrates at most meals and a snack of nuts or smoothies in between.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0I get off track from time to time, but when I do, I enjoy it and then get right back to my healthy eating.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I feel great, and that's all that matters. \u00a0If you eat a healthy diet, you will feel great, and if you feel great then, you're doing something right. Right?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So now we know that our bodies don't need detox programs because we already have a super efficient detox system which is or liver and kidneys.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, when we drink alcohol, our liver breaks it down in a two-step process, and then our kidneys wash it away. \u00a0Did you know that broccoli and other greens, even brown rice produce cyanide? \u00a0Our liver takes care of these too.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008080;\"><em>Now let's move on to Rejuvenation and what it is. \u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008080;\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/em><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Rejuvenation<\/em> is the same as renewal. \u00a0It's different from detox in that it's not about deprivation but more about eating healthy, supplementing, exercising regularly, minimizing stress and, avoiding exposure to toxins that will hurt you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Very few of us reach our potential and maximum lifespan. \u00a0Instead, we die too soon because of disease caused by free radical damage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We will start with the American diet which is high fat and processed foods, full of preservatives and, full of chemicals.

\u00a0What do you eat? \u00a0Do you eat meat?<\/p>\r\nIf you want to stop eating meat and become a vegetarian or vegan, you have stopped by the right place.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'll show how to make the switch without feeling that you have lost something but instead that you have gained a whole new lifestyle and one that is healthier and one that will extend your life and how to become a vegan or vegetarian.<\/p>\r\nFirst, let me start off by saying that I'm not here to badger you about eating meat or harming animals.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though I have been a vegetarian for about twenty-five years and ten of those years a vegan, I believe that we all must make our own choices and to each their own. \u00a0However, not eating meat would help the environment and prevent the exploitation of animals and, that in itself is a great thing because, as humans, we have emotional attachments to animals and without a balanced planet, none of us can thrive.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vegetarianism has gone mainstream. \u00a0Its cool to not eat meat. \u00a0Some famous vegetarians are Paul McCartney, Tina Turner, Leonardo Da Vinci, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Socrates, Plato and I could go on and on, but you get the point.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">HOW TO BECOME A VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">What it means to be a vegetarian or vegan<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's define what a vegetarian is first. \u00a0Vegetarians fall into three categories.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Ovo-lactovegetarian<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Lactovegetarian<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Vegan<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ovo-lactovegetarians consume eggs and dairy products. \u00a0Lactovegetarians eat dairy products but not eggs. \u00a0Vegans do not eat any food of animal origin, even dairy products.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many times, I see people that say they are vegetarian but still eat fish or chicken. \u00a0Fish and chicken are both considered meat.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then there are some that instead of eating meat, they consume a lot of dairy products like cheese and butter, \u00a0 This kind of diet has way too much saturated fat, and this is bad news for our health.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Honestly, if one were switching to vegetarianism for their health and they ate a diet like this then, it would be far wiser to keep eating lean beef which would decrease the amount of fat and cholesterol, however, keep reading because I don't recommend this either. \u00a0Also, remember the environment part and the exploitation of animals I talked about?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">\"If you wanted to stop eating meat to gain better health then I would suggest that you stop all animal products including dairy.\"<\/span><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By reading that last sentence, basically did you feel a little uneasy and think to yourself that nothing left to eat? \u00a0Or did you think that maybe you could do this and then cheat every once in while by having a nice juicy burger?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What about putting butter on your toast? Or having to go without cheese on your pizza? \u00a0These are reasonable thoughts and questions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keeping with the idea of becoming a vegetarian or vegan for your health, one could sum up these questions and more by saying that a high fat, fiberless, plant deprived, toxin-laden, animal food diet, not only shortens life but turns our final years into an extremely unpleasant experience.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead of enjoying our golden years we spend huge amounts of time and money running from doctor to doctor because of degenerative health problems.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Diseases like high blood pressure, circulatory problems, heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, brain disease, and much more. \u00a0This lowers our quality of life and \u00a0I'm saying this can mostly be avoided by my not eating animal products.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not to blame anyone but could we say that a lot of disease is self-inflicted? \u00a0What if we ate a vegetarian diet, supplemented appropriately \u00a0and exercised regularly? \u00a0Then most of the suffering that we as humans could be avoided.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What's the first step in changing your way of life by eliminating meat? \u00a0I will give you the steps that I took to become a vegetarian and then a vegan.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Vegetarian\/Vegan<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li>If you can't stop eating meat all at once, then try eliminating one animal at a time until you get to the no meat part. \u00a0This can easily be done within thirty days or so.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Replace meat with plant proteins like <strong>beans, tofu, nuts, Quinoa, Lentils,\u00a0Seitan,\u00a0Tempeh, Green Peas, nut butters, veggie burgers, protein drinks, and beans and brown rice. \u00a0<\/strong>These are only some examples of many.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Start adding more fruits and veggies with your proteins.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Eat more frequently in smaller meals.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>When dining out, order off the sides and veggie menu and eat plenty. \u00a0You will see that you can eat way more than most and still not gain weight. Use the ratio of example number seven below.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>To avoid gaining weight, don't swing to the other side and just eat carbs instead of meat. \u00a0Many people go from eating meat to only eating lot's of carbs and this will make you heavy and, it will not be good for your health.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>My food plate consists of fifty percent veggies, twenty-five percent good carbs and twenty-five percent protein.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Contrary to what most people think, you do not need a lot of protein and, you will get protein in just about everything you eat so don't worry about the nay sayers that ask \"How will you get your protein?\" \u00a0Honestly, have you ever seen someone walking around with a protein deficiency? \u00a0It could happen but it's rare.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">NOTE: \u00a0If you don't want to eat like a vegan in the eight steps above, you can eat dairy as in a vegetarian. \u00a0I did this for a while but honestly, dairy is not so good for us either. \u00a0However, I think transitioning from vegetarian first to vegan is the easiest way to go.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me say that there are a whole lot of yummy vegetarian and vegan foods to eat. \u00a0i practically live in Whole Foods and Pinterest has a ton of tasty dishes that you can save to an idea board.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can still have Mexican food, Italian food and everything else that you like. \u00a0You simply replace the meat with another protein and that's it! \u00a0Simple right?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Pinterest boards that I have save me when I'm eating out and I sometimes don't know what to eat or when, I'm craving something yummy. \u00a0I simply scroll down on my phone and find creative meals and deserts to eat. \u00a0Also, who carries around or probably even reads cookbooks anymore?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I usually pack snacks like bars and nuts and fruit so I'm not tempted to eat chips or other bad foods when I'm starving and believe me, I'm always eating because, well, I just love to eat.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That's the thing, you can eat a lot being a Vegan. \u00a0People always ask me if I have a hollow leg :) \u00a0My business partner (who is a 6'2\" man who body builds) says that I eat twice as much as him and that he always has to wait for me to finish all of my food when we go out! \u00a0You can't do that with other diets.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you go to Whole Foods and probably in your grocery store, you will see that there are deserts like rice ice-cream, almond ice-cream and so much more. \u00a0Spend some time looking at all your options and trust me, there are way more than one can imagine. \u00a0Not to mention all of the new Vegan protein options out there.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don't worry, you won't have to be rigid. \u00a0As you go along, your journey will evolve and you will learn so many ways to keep your palate happy. \u00a0Everything starts with the first step.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also recommend that you consume at least one smoothie per day when beginning the transition and keep them up if you enjoy them like I do!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I mix one scoop of vegan protein powder, 1\/2 of a banana, almond milk and some ice and this is my post workout recovery smoothie. \u00a0Tastes like a milkshake and so good.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For an antioxidant smoothie (which we should all do daily) I simply mix two handfuls of organic kale, 1\/2 cup of the almond mile, probiotics, organic blueberries, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, quarter banana, 1\/2 of lemon or lime, a little ice and blend!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The above smoothie is amazing and I drink it every morning and in the course of three months, it has reduced my cholesterol and all of my lab tests have improved dramatically. \u00a0You can always switch out the fruit for different flavors but always use the kale as your base.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before I go, I have to mention some amazing things about not eating meat and that is how you will transform. \u00a0Your skin will change, you'll have more energy (because you're eating live things not dead things, am I right?) and, \u00a0you will have better clarity. \u00a0You will also probably lose a lot of fat too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And did I mention that you just might save the planet?<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate. \u00a0I have created a six-step

because it too is bad for our health. \u00a0When it comes to desiring some sweetness in our coffee, tea, cereal or anything else for that matter, is there a safe alternative out there?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I grew up consuming loads of sugar. \u00a0My sugar of choice was the drink Coke and well, anything else that I could get my hands on that was sweet.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I was over at a friends house growing up, they would sometimes have the drink called Tab. \u00a0It was sweetened with that pink pack stuff called Sweet N Low. \u00a0To me it was pretty good but, to the health industry, it was poison.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As I grew up and started to take better care of my health, I switched from the pink packs to the blue packs of sweeteners called Aspartame. \u00a0At the time, it was a safe alternative (so they thought) to the pink packets.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, as everyone knows, Aspartame is also not good for our health. \u00a0Fast forward to about ten years ago (maybe more, maybe less), the yellow packets came out, and they were called Splenda.

Some may call this depression, but for me, it wasn't. \u00a0And, it wasn't that there was always something greater and better that I was chasing either. \u00a0I know about watering my grass.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wasn't looking to escape myself and I certainly never wanted to be anyone but me. \u00a0Sure, I could be prettier, smarter and have nicer stuff but really, does any of that make someone happy for very long?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pretty fades, smarter becomes irrelevant, and you can't take stuff with you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, I always had this little hole that I couldn't fill. \u00a0I got some therapy; I had my share of boyfriends to fill it and, I've spent my way through pretty good sums of money only to end up right back to where I had always been. \u00a0Back to me the person with the hole.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So when I turned fifty this year, life clicked for me. \u00a0I finally got it. \u00a0I was happy all along but, I was creating my unhappiness from the disappointment that I created about, all of the ways that I thought life should be.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is, life is half chance and half results.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blame it on the media, magazines, reality shows, friends or whatever but, how to be happy comes back to whether we are comfortable in our skin, at any stage in life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some are luckier than others and get this sooner than I did at fifty but, never the less, I got it before it was too late. \u00a0Better late than never for sure.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was it. \u00a0I was never comfortable in my skin. \u00a0I figured at age fifty; if I weren't comfortable by now, I'd better know how to get that way or find an exit plan because I certainly wasn't going to allow myself to grow old and bitter.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, I didn't want to walk around thinking a part of me was missing for the next half of my life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn't matter what age you are, how to be happy is about being comfortable in your skin. \u00a0It's not about comparing yourself to anything other than the person that you were yesterday. \u00a0Not tomorrow either because, you don't have\u00a0that day yet and, you may never get it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another thing that has changed me is the acceptance that life is beautiful and, it's quick and, those that we love are here one day and gone the next. \u00a0Like both my mother and my brother.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me say that when you forget that your mom has passed away but, you pick up the phone to call her, and then you realize that she is no longer there, not today, not tomorrow, not ever again, life becomes pretty sobering.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are fortunate to have not lost a parent, please, call them every day because, when you do, \u00a0you'll feel a kind of pain the hurts beyond what you thought was even possible.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we realize and contemplate that we too only have a short amount of time, we don't have much time other than to be happy. \u00a0It is our duty to ourselves to give ourselves this gift.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is what most people will remember you for. \u00a0Not stuff, not your looks, not how much money you had. \u00a0Happiness is your true legacy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know that bad things happen in life and, these things will pass. \u00a0We will all die and so will the people we love. \u00a0We will have financial difficulties, and life will sometimes punch us so hard that it knocks the wind out and sometimes, for longer than we had planned. \u00a0But, life goes on with or without us, and that's just how it is.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the acceptance part that we must do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm not here to give you a cheesy line about how grateful you should be or that what you have, others would probably wish for.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0I will say that you and I should take some time every day to remember how short life is and, understand that we don't have a lot of time other than to live our lives to the fullest while we are here for the short period that we are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no magic to being happy. \u00a0The secret is to accept the beautiful life that God has given, don't over think, add a little gratitude and, keep smiling knowing that you have this day which may be your last.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate. \u00a0I have created a

lunch.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Eat your lunch later in the day, say around 1:00 or 2:00 pm. and eat a meal that is about 300 calories with protein, carbs, and veggies.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Eat a<span

I should have listened.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, when my father-in-law said that he too takes aspirin every day, I decided to do some research for myself to see if my skin was changing because of the aspirin?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is what I found:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Inflammation takes its toll on your skin in a variety of ways such as acne, rosacea and visible signs of aging, like wrinkles and sagging skin. Collagen is key to keeping your joints and your skin functioning younger; by boosting your skin structure, collagen helps it to look full, smoother and elastic. When that structure breaks down, your skin starts to sag, wrinkle and look less vibrant. High levels of inflammation also cause a faster rate of collagen breakdown, which accelerates the aging \"look.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: (http:\/\/health.usnews.com\/health-news\/blogs\/eat-run\/2013\/12\/17\/take-aspirin-at-night-to-reap-its-health-and-beauty-benefits)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be honest with you too, my stomach tends to be a little upset lately. \u00a0I'm sure it's because of the aspirin. However, those little aches and pains that I used to get are almost nonexistent lately.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think I will complete a cycle of one month to see how it goes and probably check with my doctor too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Please don't be like me and begin an aspirin routine without checking with your doctor. \u00a0It could be detrimental to your health especially if you're on blood thinners.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is aspirin a hidden beauty secret?

Smith, M.D. in his book \"Renewal,\" he suggests to his patients that they take \"24 percent standardized extract.\"\n\nStandardized means that basically, it was verified in an approved lab and measured for its effectiveness.\n\nAs per Dr. Timothy J. Smith, he suggests to stay clear of all non-standardized products because one never knows if they are getting a therapeutic dose or not.\n\nTo recap here, taking a standardized Ginkgo every day has proven to help with the nervous system, circulatory system,\u00a0and sensory system.\n\nReferenced from: \"Renewal\" By Timothy J.

But, that's just me :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If this were possible most of us would not only be living in our dream home and driving that awesome sports car but, we would have won the lottery as well. \u00a0In fact, I wouldn't even be writing this post because it wouldn't be relevant.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Receiving what we dream of is completely possible but, no one knocks on your door and gives it to you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing is impossible just the impossibility of getting what we want without the effort.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, this brings me to the flip side of this topic. \u00a0And that is, do we create what we fear?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those who believe they can manifest all of the material things that they want through the mind's eye, they may not think that the same thing is possible for the things that they don't wan't.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Creating what we fear is easier because, without realizing it, we put a lot more energy into running from our fears than running after what we want.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The difference is that, what we put into the back of our mind (the fear rather than the desires in the front of our mind) have a funny way of making themselves come true.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's the constant thinking and awareness of what we are afraid of that we keep tightly suspended at all times keeping ourselves fully aware of the pain that it will cause so, we do everything to avoid what we hold in our mind only to actually, attract that very thing that we fear?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can't tell you how much I have done this. \u00a0With the exception of one or two things, almost everything that I was afraid of has happened to me. Well, it didn't happen by itself, but by me creating what I feared.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example. \u00a0My mother was married many times and me and my brothers all had different fathers that we never met.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I was younger, I said that I would never be like my mother and when I got married, I would stay with the father of my kids so that they would not only have a stable life with a father that loved them but, they would always have two parents to be there for them (this was my fear).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the most part, I achieved this however, I held on so tight that I caused a lot more problems by holding onto the fear of not wanting to be like my mother.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There have been many times in my business that my decisions were counter intuitive to what needed to be done because of fear, which lead me into situations where the decision that I made had nothing to do with the business but, by me wanting to avoid what I feared only, to create the exact opposite.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's like as soon as you decide that you fear something, a universal magnet of some sort begins it's process in your subconscious mind and then, it's only a matter of time before that exact outcome happens.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Through out my mothers life, she worried that she'd end up alone. She was so afraid of it that it paralyzed her ability to have good relationships therefore, creating exactly what she feared.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When a man would come into my mothers life, he was usually a loser which is what she attracted (the fear of being alone) which then, manifested her belief system.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother died alone, two months ago of a methadone overdose on her couch. \u00a0She created exactly what she feared and the thing is, she felt this way since I was a small child. \u00a0She basically manifested and created the way that she would eventually die.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I have learned one thing about creating what we fear it is to stop thinking about the negative things and, anytime the fear of what might or could happen, replace that thought with a positive one.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don't tell yourself negative stories and for sure, try not to see a negative story unfold in your mind and, for sure, don't believe the lies that your mind tells you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These kinds of stories have no place in our lives. \u00a0Our lives are not destined to be the story that we create but, only the story that we put into energy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The difference is, which side will you put your energy into? \u00a0The fear or the desire. \u00a0Because, this is how either side will happen.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The real key to manifesting the things that you dream about are from letting go and freeing yourself from the things that you are fearful of.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate. \u00a0I have created a six-step course called \"The Rejuvenation Program\"<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">\u00a0You can check it out by clicking this link:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com\">http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/> The Rejuvenation Program\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Marriage<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Wellness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Marriage<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Wellness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">do we create what we fear<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">dreams<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">fear<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">How to avoid fear<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to get what you want<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">manifestation<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">stop worrying<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the lottery<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/37959342_s-1-400x280.jpg"},{"id":1049,"slug":"easy-3-day-detox-rejuvenation-plan","type":"post","title":"Easy 3-Day Detox & Rejuvenation Plan","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7950 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/fb-01-3-300x111.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"111\" \/>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Easy 3-Day Detox &amp; Rejuvenation Plan<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<u>\u00a0<\/u>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><u>Drink<\/u><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The \"Easy 3-day detox &amp; rejuvenation plan\"\u00a0is to eliminate waste from your body a get rid of toxins.\u00a0 Drink 10 to 12 glasses of purified water per day.

style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosh. \u00a0I hate to even write about this subject. \u00a0Any woman that has been married for a long time has thought about this topic at least once. Or worse, they have lived through this themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I heard someone say \"they always go younger\" and damn it if it's not true!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anyways, a sort of friend of mine (we know each other through mutual friends) just went through this experience but, not only did her husband leave her for a younger woman, the woman was someone that they both knew very well. \u00a0A double heart stab!!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I heard the news, and I felt really bad for her. \u00a0I wondered how I would be able to handle this if it happened to me. \u00a0Let's be real here, as I get older; it seems that the woman is getting younger and younger by the minute!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My man gets hit on all the time, and he works with many attractive younger women. \u00a0If I didn't have trust and he wasn't the kind of man he is, I'd be a little worried sometimes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I saw this woman at a wedding recently, and I didn't want to say anything about her situation but, I wanted to let her know that I was there for her if she needed anything. \u00a0So I was happy and surprised when she started telling me that she was hanging in there after what happened (she gave me the full story).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being that I love to write and I love to get real-life stories from people, I asked her how the hell she was getting through her husband coming home one day, packing his stuff and, telling her he was leaving her for this family friend! \u00a0I'm pissed just thinking about it now!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anyways, she said she was taking it day by day and that one day she hoped to be okay and, to actually find a man and get married again. She was married to the other dude for twenty plus years.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After talking with her, I realized or determined that I should have titled this blog post as \"how to through when he leaves you for a younger woman\" because after talking with her this is the way to do it:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You take it day by day. \u00a0You don't take it personally because it's his cowardness, not yours. You don't compare yourself to her; you don't beat yourself up whatsoever, you give time, time, and, you trust and believe that YOU WILL find someone that is a real man that won't leave you for any reason.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate. \u00a0I have created a six-step course called \"The Rejuvenation Program\"<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">\u00a0You can check it out by clicking this link:\u00a0http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/> The Rejuvenation Program\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Dating<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Marriage<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Dating<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Marriage<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">cheating<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">cheating man<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">divorce<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to get over your ex<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to love again<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to move on after divorce<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">love<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">marriage<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">When he leaves you for a younger woman<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/37921123_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":1011,"slug":"the-truth-about-anti-aging-stem-cells-and-growth-factors","type":"post","title":"Anti-aging stem cells and growth factors in skin care","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Anti-aging stem cells and growth factors in skin care<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's tough fighting the effects of aging. \u00a0They say the older you get, the faster you get older. \u00a0I know you don't want to hear that. \u00a0I sure don't! But it's true.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's easier to fight the effects of aging on our face than our body because we have different cells that turn over much better above the neck. I'm not going to go into all the layers and cells of the skin because frankly, I'm not a Dermatologist and the point here is to find ways NOW, that work, to anti-age and re-engineer our skin.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, I'm not talking about not aging because let's face it; we're not going to get out of here alive! \u00a0With that said, I say, why can't we age fantastically too?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am so fascinated with aging and on how we can reverse, fend off, or just stop using numbers to signify the stage of life that we're at.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is also the reality of being a woman of a certain age (say 50, or so) that you kind of disappear\u00a0in society. \u00a0People look past us sometimes and honestly, that can cause one a bit of insecurity. \u00a0Well at least for me sometimes.<\/p>\r\nThe great thing is that at 50 we start to look inside ourselves and not so much on the outside (too bad society but, regardless of what you see, we see a beautiful person that feels good inside).

A stem cell can actually turn into an organ depending on the signals that it's given. Pretty amazing I think!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just like inflammation in the body causes diseases like heart disease and cancer, most aging skin is also caused by inflammation.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, something internal or environmental happens, we get free radicals and then, inflammation sets in and boom! You've got a new wrinkle, sagging skin or whatever. \u00a0You wake up, look in the mirror and swear that your face changed over night!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cytokines are growth factors made from stem cells. \u00a0By using these in our skincare, we can create an anti-inflammatory response.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We couldn't just take our own or someone else's stem cells and then throw them into our moisturizer because, they are not stable enough by themselves. \u00a0Believe me, I would have already done this if it was possible :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em><strong>Let's move on here..<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\nSo when companies say they are using stem cells in their products, they mean that \"they are usually using ingredients derived from stem cells\" (Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D.)\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Diana Draelos, M.D. professor of dermatology, says that stem cells need to be purified and grown in Petri dishes. \u00a0They need to be fed a high protein diet with, amino acids and, glucose. (Hmm.. maybe this is the type of skin diet I can research for us all?)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em><strong>Here's how stem cells get their beauty:<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\nWhen stem cells are in the Petri dish, they have contact with other stem cells and then start to communicate thus, creating growth factors. These growth factors create signals to cause other cells to change or grow, etc.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main sources of stem cells are plants, animals and humans. \u00a0Long story short (without going into all the scientific part), we don't need to hurt humans or do anything immoral or unethical to get them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Labs can grow stem cells by bio-engineering them from our own cells, (or from another person), umbilical cords, bone marrow, placentas, and, fat tissue. \u00a0Stem cells from fat can be directly used without any modifications. Now how do I get my fat cells out of my body and into my moisturizer?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The problem with buying beauty products that say they have growth factors from stem cells is, efficacy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When buying skincare products with stem cells, ask the company how they get them. Price doesn't determine quality either.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, we won't grow younger using stem cells but by using them, we have some of the most potent tools to allow our skin to have a new life and with that, less wrinkles and firmer skin.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">sourced from: new you magazine 2016<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate. \u00a0I have created a six-step course called \"The Rejuvenation Program\"<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">\u00a0You can check it out by clicking this link:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com\">http:\/\/www.therejuvenationprogram.com<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/> The Rejuvenation Program","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">growth factors<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to look younger<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">skin care<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">smoother skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">stem cells<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">stem cells and anti aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">wrinkles<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/16530810_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":1019,"slug":"how-hormone-replacement-therapy-works","type":"post","title":"How hormone replacement testing works","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">How hormone replacement\u00a0testing works<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When replacing natural hormones, the most common are estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, thyroid, adrenal, melatonin, DHEA, pregnenolone, and human growth hormones.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To get accurate results from HRT (hormone replacement therapy), it is imperative to find a doctor who is trained for more than relying on just blood tests and symptoms, because without the proper data, hormone replacement therapy can make a situation worse.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some believe the responsible way of testing one's hormone levels is by using a circadian testing method. \u00a0This means that the hormone levels be monitored over a 24 hour period.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This provides a more comprehensive way to represent hormone levels. Our hormone levels change throughout the day, and an easy way to test this is by doing a saliva test which can determine hormonal imbalances.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, one would give saliva samples at specific times during a 24 hour period. \u00a0This has its advantages over giving blood because who would want the pain of needles when they can just give a little saliva?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And, this can be done anywhere at any time. \u00a0Saliva can remain stable for up to five days and can be mailed so the patient can perform the samples themselves and then ship them off to the lab.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, hormone levels are higher when we wake up, so it makes sense to be able to test them at home rather than to travel to a doctors office while hormone levels drop.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The saliva test cost is typically less expensive than blood tests.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Here are some of the reasons that a women's hormones can become unbalanced:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li>Eating food that has hormones added to it.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Consuming supplements and herbs that have an estrogenic effect.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Birth control or other HRT.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Environmental toxins that mimic estrogen (plastics, pesticides).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Exposure to radiation.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>I bet you didn't even think about this one! Chronic constipation. \u00a0Estrogen builds up in the colon and then is reabsorbed.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Liver toxicity.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each person's HRT is different because of genetics and lifestyle.

Or, does love fade and become distant when there is no physical intimacy?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know these are some deep questions, but really, as our population ages and as we age, if our partner is impotent, will our love still deepen, stay the same or, could there be some bitterness eventually?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While doing research on this topic, I came across many different opinions. \u00a0I was surprised to read in many cases that a man's impotence is highly caused, not by his inability to perform but, \u00a0for his lack of desire to do so. \u00a0Hmmm.?

Just think if someone were depressed and they had all the money to throw at the problem and, it didn't work. \u00a0Where would the hope be?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don't have depression (thank God) but I know depression because, I watched many of my dear family members struggle from it and then lose the battle with it. \u00a0Depression is not pretty, it's delusional and it's something that if you haven't lived with it, you can never fully respect it's devastation.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To ask someone \"why are you depressed\" or say to them \"try and be happy\" or, \"get over it\" is like saying to a dying cancer patient, \"just get your out of bed and will yourself better.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depression doesn't care about the person that it occupies. \u00a0It puts that person in a deep dark hole that most can't or don't climb out of.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, there may be medication and talk therapy but, I don't see a lot of people recovering completely. \u00a0I think once it grabs on to your soul, you try and try as you may, you can't ever fully rid yourself of it's disgusting grip.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know people can live with depression just like diabetes, aids, and other diseases however, these are diseases of the body that allow one to move about the day but having a disease of the mind and one of the spirit, stays with you twenty-four seven. \u00a0It never lets go and, never allows one to live with intention.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two weeks ago, my mother finally found peace by overdosing on Methadone. \u00a0I was in awe when I saw her sweet little body on her couch. \u00a0I could see that she was no longer in spiritual pain and she was set free from the darkness that lived in her soul. \u00a0I was happy for her and I knew this day would come. \u00a0I was very sad but something in me found a comfort that I can't explain.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genetically, the odds are against me. \u00a0Genetically they are against my children and, honestly the cycle has continued to where I can't say now however, when someone asks why a depressed person just can't be happy, I respond back with \"yeah and why can't a brain tumor just magically disappear with only a smile.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">living with depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">overcoming depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">overdose<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">suicide<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">why am I depressed?fighting depression<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/mentalillness-e1451995715330.jpg"},{"id":943,"slug":"what-is-twice-as-likely-to-kill-you-as-high-cholesterol","type":"post","title":"What is twice as likely to kill you as high cholesterol?","content":"<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is twice as likely to kill you as high cholesterol?<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Answer: A body that doesn't move!

However, that's not how society works now, is it?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women are not allowed to age, and this is one of the recent blog posts that I wrote about and, let's face it if I were selling something, a younger version of me on video would probably be more successful.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, I have two points to this blog post, and one is, well about the topic of course, will I be okay in the end looking old just like everyone else? Or, will I try and delay it and run from it and, get plastic surgery along the way?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Look at Jane Fonda and Raquel Welch; they look pretty good. \u00a0I don't see a problem with them. \u00a0But, there comes a time of diminishing return meaning that no matter how much of what they do, the foundation is just not there anymore, and they will have to give in just like the rest of us.\u00a0They begin to look their age only abnormally because those their age don't look that way.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People think that its gravity that makes them age, and so they get a facelift, and they think they look better and maybe, get a second one but, they also need to know that it's our bones that are shrinking and not so much as our skin slipping down.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can verify this by seeing the way a person ages in their eyes. \u00a0We can nip, tuck, pull and, add volume but the eyes say it all.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">In the end, we will all look old<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's also the fact that we lose fat and tissue as we age and a lift doesn't help this either. \u00a0Sure, we can get fillers, but then, we become a slave to them too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, then some people will age faster than others due to lifestyle and genetics, but the reality is, we will all get there about the same time. \u00a0Is it really worth it to fight it? \u00a0I would hate a life where I was so preoccupied with fighting aging every day that one day I woke up and my life was never lived because I was so afraid to age.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are afraid because again, it's not okay in our society but, we can't be consumed by what society says is okay. \u00a0Women have enough pressure we certainly don't need to have to become a slave to aging too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So my point here again (sorry, but if you read this blog you know that I am happily affected by ADHD) then I think one, I won't run after the plastic surgery route (although I will get non invasive treatments) and two, I will go ahead and start creating video because I think that, if I don't show the world how a woman is supposed to age then who will?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you want to look and feel younger? Do this and have a life that will keep you happy and healthy for a lot longer than the average woman.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you seriously want smoother skin then check out my \"Smooth Skin\" course where I will show you exactly how I get it. \u00a0No needles, fillers or surgeons needed here!<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">https:\/\/how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8358\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/How-to-get-old-and-be-happy-300x251.png\" alt=\"Smooth Skin Course\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/> How to get smooth skin without a doctor!\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Wellness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Wellness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">getting old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to age gracefully<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">In the end<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">live your best life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">looking old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">plastic surgery<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">we will all look old<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/36953033_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":842,"slug":"parasites-in-your-body","type":"post","title":"Parasites in your body","content":"<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Parasites in your body<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAccording to the CDC, one in six Americans is host to a parasite. \u00a0Next to lice, the most common parasite that humans have is the microscopic protozoal variety. \u00a0This can be transmitted by air, food, bugs, animals, water and other people.\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Parasites in your body<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another type of parasite is worms. \u00a0Pinworms, roundworms, and tapeworms. \u00a0Most parasites go undetected because they don't produce serious problems or they produce symptoms that can be attributed to another cause such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, bloating, some allergies, diarrhea, abdominal pain and many more.\u00a0Parasites and organisms survive by feeding off each other.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Symptoms of a parasitic infection usually happen within three to five days after being exposed. \u00a0Below are some of the risk factors for getting a parasitic infection:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li>Traveling outside the U.S.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Drinking out of streams and rivers.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Household pets.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Eating sushi.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Eating raw, undercooked meat and, raw fish.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Working in a hospital or daycare.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Oral and anal sex.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Not washing hands often and properly.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An accurate diagnosis is a must because different parasites require different methods to kill them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you think that you have a parasite, then have your doctor test you by using the CDC guidelines (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/parasites\/references_resources\/diagnosis.html\">http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/parasites\/references_resources\/diagnosis.html<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of the ways to test are a stool test, rectal mucus swab and, blood tests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Parasites in your body<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most doctors use antibiotics and other drugs to fight parasites.

&nbsp;But then, I realized how selfish that would be if I did wait and how unfair it would be for the person on the other side making the call.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I got out of bed, got my phone and went into the living room. &nbsp;It was my brother and in a sad and raspy voice he told me that our mother had passed away on her living room couch all alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earlier in the day, he and our mother had gotten into an argument (which was happening more often between them) and that he had storm out the door. &nbsp;When he returned that night, he saw her laying on the couch but the weird thing was that, she was laying in the same position for seven hours. &nbsp;He said when he saw her he knew that she had passed away.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I told him to call 911 and go outside and that I would come over. &nbsp;I sat silently in my living room for two hours just wondering if I really wanted to rush over to my mothers house and see her dead on her couch. &nbsp;I just didn't think I could handle seeing her laying there and I certainly didn't want that to be my last memory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, something came over me and I took a shower, got ready and made the forty-five minute drive to her house.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I drove up and saw the police outside as the EMS had already left. &nbsp;I knew there was only one person we were waiting for and that was the coroner. &nbsp;As I got out of my car and talked to the police, I watched my brother pacing on the front lawn. &nbsp;I hugged him and he said, \"Terry, if you want to see her, you can look through the living room windows and see her laying on the couch.\"<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">His words felt like a knife piercing my heart. &nbsp;Did I really want to see her or did I want to remember the last time I saw her? &nbsp;I didn't want to remember so much the last time I saw her because it was the Thursday before and it didn't go so well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I went to her house to visit and she looked horrible. &nbsp;Her clothes looked ratty, she smelled like cigarettes and she only weighed about seventy-five pounds. She just looked awful and I wasn't going to have it!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I grabbed my moms arm and told her to sit down. &nbsp;I scolded her about her appearance and begged her to tell me what was going on with her. &nbsp;She assured me that she didn't know why she was losing so much weight and that she was eating but she just didn't feel well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I told her that if she didn't start eating and taking care of herself that I would call a Social Worker and have them come over and do whatever was necessary to find out what was really going on with her. &nbsp;I gave her some new clothes and I told her that she should put on some makeup, fresh clothes and start taking care of herself. &nbsp;I told her that the next time I saw her, I didn't want to see her like she was then.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I saw the pain in her eyes and I also knew in my heart that her spirit way dying. &nbsp;She was dying. &nbsp;It broke my heart and I just couldn't add to her pain. &nbsp;After all, I'm the one who has tried to save her for most of her life. My mother eyes told everything and right there they were telling me that she was more like my child.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I said \"mom, I'm not here to be mean to you. &nbsp;I just want you to be okay. &nbsp;I want you to be happy. &nbsp;I don't like to see you this way.\" &nbsp;She said to me that she didn't think I was being mean but that, I loved her and that I cared about her. &nbsp;That made me happy and we sat and talked for a bit. &nbsp;Now I wish it had been longer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her words comfort me every time I doubt myself and think that I could have done something more to save her.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know they say you don't know how strong you are until you have to be and man that is so true. &nbsp;I lost my younger brother two years ago and I think this is when my mom gave up. &nbsp;In a short time after my brother died, she lost the only man that loved her and my other brother developed a brain tumor. &nbsp;I think some people are just not as strong as others and in my mothers case, she was probably born a very weak soul.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not to say that if you lose a child it shouldn't weaken you because I never ever want to find this out and, I could only imagine how much will it takes to pull yourself out of a dark hole and try to move on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother lived in a dark hole and she could never pull herself out. &nbsp;The good times didn't last for long for her, when they came, she worried about how long they would last. &nbsp;She never lived in the moment, ever.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Today I picked up my mothers ashes. &nbsp;They gave me her final belongings which was a cross and a St. Christoper that she wore around her neck to keep her safe and so that God would know that she was afraid of dying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I thought that picking up her ashes would affect me worse than it did but, it was more of a feeling of peace. &nbsp;I knew the ashes were not her and that she was now free.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It feels comforting to me knowing how much spiritual pain that my mother was in that now her body is strong, her mind is free and her soul is happy for once. &nbsp;Although I rarely saw this, I remember her last words were, \"and I love you.\"<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Someone asked my if I think it was harder to lose my mother in a sudden passing as compared to losing her to cancer and watching her suffer or die slowly and I told them that, I watched my mom die my whole life. &nbsp;And, it will always haunt me to know or think that her only daughter couldn't save her from herself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don't want to ever minimize the way anyone dies because when you lose someone you love it hurts deep no matter what the circumstance is. &nbsp;When you watch someone in pain, no matter what kind of pain it's agonizing. &nbsp;I have learned that it's also a blessing to allow them to be free and to appreciate that they are.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Christmas Eve, like I had done for so many years before, I picked up my cell phone and dialed her number to tell her Merry Christmas but, as the phone rang, I realized that she was gone and that I would never talk to her again. &nbsp;I will never see her again and I will never get to hug her frail little body ever again. &nbsp;I put my phone down and cried in a Walgreen's parking lot.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother died of an accidental drug over dose by using Methadone. &nbsp;I know it wasn't exactly intentional because while saying my final good bye to her on the couch, I noticed that she had her done, she put on makeup and was wearing the new clothes that I bought her.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She listened to me that day when I told her the next time I saw her that I didn't want to see her the way she was and she was all made up. &nbsp;Maybe she knew where she was going or maybe she wanted to look nice for me, that I'll never know.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My question or wonder is, is it suicide when you don't intend to kill yourself but you use drugs? &nbsp;I don't know but, if you use drugs to escape then you are already committing spiritual suicide because you don't feel comfortable in your own body and for that, her intentions are what they are.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rest in peace my sweet dear mother. &nbsp;I know you tried and I know that you're in heaven and your with your son and, I know most of all that you loved me as best as you could. I'll see you again one day and on that day we won't have to worry about the elephant that was always in the room. &nbsp;We can celebrate together.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Goodbye Momma you're free now..<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">*The picture on this blog post is of the time when my mom was happy for a minute. &nbsp;I took her back to where she grew up. &nbsp;This is how I will remember her..

I'm sure like many others before me, when you turn 50 you just can't believe it. \u00a0How did I get here, and who am I?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where did the time go? \u00a0I still remember being fifteen and laying on a San Diego beach in my teeny bikini thinking that I would never get old.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that I'm about to flip the half century mark, it's both a scary and somewhat comforting at the same time. \u00a0One reason is because a week ago, I lost my mom suddenly right before Christmas and when you lose your mom it puts life in perspective. Not only did I never think I would get old but, I never thought my mom would die.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly, the world looks different now. \u00a0Would it look as different if my mother hadn't passed away while turning 50? \u00a0I don't know but since she passed, I look at the sky more. \u00a0I look around at the world and think about how lucky I am to be here. \u00a0I realize more and more that life is flying by and I wan't to slow it down but I can't.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have to be grateful for being 50 because there are those who never made it to 50 and for that, I am blessed to be able to. \u00a0My mother and I had a unique relationship and to make a long story short, I loved her dearly while she had a hard time loving my back but, in the end, she did try and she did show me she loved me in the very best way that she could. Her soul is free and I am at peace.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe her passing was her gift to me so that I could stop running around taking life for granted for the time that I have left. \u00a0She could never give me much but, for some reason, for as weird as it sounds, she gave me the ability to fully appreciate my life for once.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Honestly, I thought for my 50th birthday I would be giving myself a divorce because like many couples that have been married for almost thirty years, we had a lot of ups and downs and, for a while there, I pretty much figured that for the rest our relationship, it would be down and we would fall into the same situation as all of the couples before us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thankfully, through life, there will be times where you really think that you should leave and that, you'd be better off but, those are the times where you should do nothing and just wait it out. \u00a0Things do get better it's just that couples evolve both together and as individuals. \u00a0Sometimes you have to wait for the other one to catch up and vise versa.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While I now don't have to worry about taking care of an aging parent or finding a new life if I were on my own, I have the time and the resources to step back and get to know myself. \u00a0Something that I thought I knew but clearly I really didn't. I'm just beginning to feel the spiritual side of who I really am.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For my 50th birthday, the gift that I wan't more than anything is not some trip around the world to say that I saw everything (although someday that would be nice), but more of a journey with myself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A journey that takes me to a place inside that trusts herself, loves herself, stops sabotaging herself and, instead of trying to be like everyone else, embraces the god given spirit and uniqueness that is inside of me. \u00a0I think everyone owes themselves this gift. \u00a0Otherwise we just breeze through life and get to end and wonder where it went and why didn't we use it better.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I've learned one thing (okay a few things) in my 50 years it would be to love myself more, accept myself always, and to relax that anxious person inside and lastly, to quit stepping back in a crowd so that I wouldn't stand out but rather, step forward and shine in the light that I was given for such a short time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here's to turning 50!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Marriage<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Marriage<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">fifty years old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to age well<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">turning 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">what fifty looks like<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">what to do for your 50th birthday<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/meandbrandi4-400x280.jpg"},{"id":769,"slug":"theres-no-place-old-people","type":"post","title":"There's no place for old people","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">There's no place for old people<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I've always said \"there's no place for old people.\" &nbsp;I'm turning 50 next month and yeah, I know, I was young once. &nbsp;I have nothing against the younger generation as I see them as being one of the most creative generations there has ever been.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I didn't say the most inventive (but close) however, definitely, the most creative. &nbsp;To live in a time of such creativity with the minds of young people that create systems and platforms from just pure imagination, is a gift that I feel honored to be a part of.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's be honest here, my mother is 71 years old and she has no clue about technology, apps or, where the world has the potential to go.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The closest thing she sees outside of her world is the YouTube channel that I set up for her on her living room television.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She's fascinated to see the world through the eyes of others, more specifically, through real life videos and what she has and will, never experience.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is, at her age, YouTube will be the closest that she'll ever get to a world outside of herself. &nbsp;And with that, I say, have fun mom.. Do what makes you happy while you still can.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back to my initial topic of \"there's no place for old people.\" &nbsp;Sorry my ADHD kicks in quite often!! &nbsp;Actually, about every five seconds and it's only getting worse as I age.. But it's also my gift as well as my curse.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Okay, now what was I talking about? Oh yeah!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They say the older you get the faster you get older. &nbsp;I know what this means because the last ten to twenty years have flown by. &nbsp;Each day flies by in fact, and I watch the clock and instead of when I was younger, wanting the time to go by as fast as possible, I watch the clock as my heart sinks and I fear that another day is about to end. I hate how fast time is going but, I have no control over time. We're all going to get old whether we like it or not.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm getting older and if life goes faster now that I'm older then how much longer do I have, I wonder? &nbsp;Right now I still look reasonably okay and I am able to do anything physically. &nbsp;The real worry is when, I get to that age where I'm really old and when people look past me. &nbsp;Like being invisible. Which is not very far away even if I still feel and act like I'm eighteen!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Society loves youth and society rewards youth and, probably like most others, I feel like I didn't appreciate my youth when I had it. &nbsp;With that said, I like most people, did the best I could with what I had, and for that, I am grateful for who I am today.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I could sum up what I'm trying to say here is just read the lyrics the Baz Luhrmann, Wear Sunscreen song below.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth\nOh, never mind&nbsp;You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded&nbsp;But trust me, in 20 years you\u2019ll look back at photos of yourself\nAnd recall in a way you can\u2019t grasp now&nbsp;How much possibility lay before you\nAnd how fabulous you really looked\"\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don\u2019t worry about the future\nOr worry&nbsp;But know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum&nbsp;The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind&nbsp;The kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some idle Tuesday\nDo one thing everyday that scares you\"\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don\u2019t be reckless with other people\u2019s hearts&nbsp;Don\u2019t put up with people who are reckless with yours\"<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don\u2019t waste your time on jealousy&nbsp;Sometimes you\u2019re ahead, sometimes you\u2019re behind\nThe race is long&nbsp;And in the end, it\u2019s only with yourself\"\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults&nbsp;If you succeed in doing this, tell me how\"<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don't know about you but, I think those are some pretty powerful lyrics and you pretty much have to be older to appreciate them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I feel like I have some time to do the things that I want and to love the people who are in my life and, who I know &nbsp;will naturally leave me sooner than I hope.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe that's the key to getting old. &nbsp;We become fulfilled with the love that we give and the things we did while we are here. &nbsp;Once you can or have done this, you can begin to step back and let others have the space that you once had.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe its not looking at others like they're taking your space at all but, it's just the natural form of energy that we as old people have to transfer so that energy can re-circulate so that, the younger generation can have it to use.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whatever the rest of my days will bring me and no matter how fast they come, I will remember that, &nbsp;I got to live an incredible life because it was my life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if didn't create some huge powerful company, an app that changed the world or, I wasn't the most beautiful woman in the world, I had the opportunity to grow old and for some they don't even get that chance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All that will matter in the space and time I have left is that I was born, born free, I created some beautiful kids and I was nice, giving, loving and compassionate towards others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I guess the whole point to this blog post is not so much about \"there's no place for old people\" but about \"reflection is the greatest gift an old person can give themself.\"<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here's to our place :)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">*Since writing this post, my mom passed away..

I love Zicam and here's why!<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Last Sunday, I got a call from my brother at one in the morning telling me that my mother had passed away. \u00a0Needless to say, I was very sad and super stressed out, realizing that my world had just flipped upside down. \u00a0On the day that you lose your mom is the day that the world will never be the same.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although this post isn't about my mother's passing, it does have something to do with the topic of Zicam Cold Remedy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two days after my mother's passing, I woke up with a sore throat and a heavy feeling in my chest. \u00a0I have to say that knock on wood, I haven't had a cold in probably ten years. \u00a0I take some great supplements and try to keep myself healthy and disease free.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With that said, when I woke up that morning, I knew that I had a cold coming on and that it was probably brought on my the stress of losing my mother. \u00a0I believe so much that when our body's are under stress, our body's have to manifest themselves in some way. \u00a0My cold was my body's way of dealing with my emotional toll.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother passed five days before Christmas this year (2015) so, not only did I have to organize her funeral, I also had to continue to keep living life and deal with the holidays so that, my family would know that I was going to be okay.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing was that, the more I tried to continue on, the more I felt my cold coming on. \u00a0I had congestion and I felt weak and, I knew that if I didn't get better quick, this was one of those colds that would last for weeks and, I just didn't have time for it right now!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is when I remembered that I had read something about Zicam Cold Remedy. \u00a0I remembered the article said, \"Zicam reduces the duration of a cold\" so I figured, if I got some, I really didn't have anything to lose if it didn't actually work. \u00a0I was getting a cold anyways.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I got the Zicam nasal swabs. \u00a0The first day I used them just like the directions said and a little more than the directions said. \u00a0I broke up the swab, swirled it around the inside of my nostrils and repeated this several times per hour for that entire day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next day, I woke up and I swear, I didn't have one symptom. \u00a0The day before, I walked around with a box of Puff's, nose running, sore throat, \u00a0chest hurting and, I really felt awful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn't believe it. \u00a0I thought it was a fluke. \u00a0I thought for sure that my symptoms would return but they didn't. \u00a0And the next day, on Christmas Eve, I felt even better. \u00a0On Christmas Day, I had not one symptom of having a cold.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, some may not think that I actually didn't have a cold and that, maybe it was some kind of allergy. \u00a0But, I don't think so because , I have allergies to cedar and the cedar for this week has been extremely low and, I take allergy medicine when this happens.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had a full blown Winter cold coming on and I used Zicam Cold Remedy and it worked! It's pretty sweet when a product makes a claim and it actually does what it says!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love Zicam Cold Remedy because not only did it stop my cold dead in it's tracks, it also gave me the time I needed to grieve for my mother and be with my family for the holidays.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">*This is not a sponsored post.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Before you go, I created \"The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\" In just seven<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><em>https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n&nbsp;","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Wellness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Wellness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">common cold<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to get rid of a cold<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to reduce a cold<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">what caused a cold<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">zicam cold remedy<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/placeholder-image.jpg"},{"id":7022,"slug":"i-love-goodrx-com-heres-why","type":"post","title":"I love GoodRx.com!!

If you read this blog, you probably know that I write fifty-percent about health issues and the other half about anti aging and, aging issues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I've also written a book about \"The secret to getting products and procedures cheap\" and in it, I tell you how to get these for less than retail. &nbsp;In one chapter (the products) I write about how I found Retin-A online at Canadapharmacy.com and, up until yesterday, that was my go to place to get it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don't know what Retin-A is, I will give you a quick explanation and move on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What is Retin-A?&nbsp;Retin-A (tretinoin) is a form of vitamin A that helps the skin renew itself and is used&nbsp;to reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and mottled skin discoloration, and to make rough facial skin feel smoother.\" (http:\/\/www.drugs.com\/retin-a.html)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn't agree more with the statement above as, I have been using Retin-A for about twenty years and it has really changed my skin. &nbsp;That said, you can't get it without a prescription and even worse, most (if not all) insurance plans don't cover it because of it's cosmetic use.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So until I found canadapharmacy.com, I was paying retail about $275.00 for a tube of Retin-A that only lasted me about six weeks (if that).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's be real here, I'm turning 50 next month and I've seriously done some sun damage and I need this stuff everywhere! &nbsp;I can't be skimping on a product that really works because of it's price! &nbsp;With canadapharmacy.com I paid about $95.00 and I was happy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The downside was that I had to wait a few weeks for them to mail it but, so long as I ordered it before running out of what I had, I was good. &nbsp;But that's the thing, I didn't always stay on top of it and I ended up having to pay retail a lot just to use Retin-A consistently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now is where GoodRx.com comes in! &nbsp;I came across their website by accident and on their website, they have a search bar and I put the name Retin-A in and they came back with prices of five or so pharmacy's in my area with competing prices!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I almost fell out of my chair because, not only was the price $50.00 at CVS but, the tube size was double! &nbsp;I thought, this was too good to be true. &nbsp;You know, the old bait and switch thing?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I figured I didn't have anything to lose and I downloaded the coupon on my phone, took my prescription to CVS, they scanned the coupon on my phone and, done!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pharmacy clerk told me these sweet words \"$50.00 and it will be ready in fifteen minutes!\" &nbsp;I stood there like I had won something or that I needed to feel guilty because I was kind of ripping them off somehow.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dumb way to think right? &nbsp;Since the drug companies obviously rip-off us consumers but, that is a another blog post and I won't let my ADHD kick in right now!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn't believe it! &nbsp;I happen to have another prescription for skin bleach (you know to lighten all the sun damage on my legs too!) and the clerk downloaded another coupon for me from GoodRx.com and, the cost was $20.00! &nbsp;I have been paying $69.00 dollars for the same product!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Long story short ( I know, none of my stories are short), if you have any prescription, covered my insurance or not, run it through GoodRx.com and check out the cash\/coupon price of competing pharmacies. &nbsp;You just might be surprised on how much money you will save.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I figure I'm saving a couple hundred dollars a month to do what I wan't with..

My business partner did of course. Sure, I ate more food but not even as many calories as he did.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">See that's the thing, you can eat a lot (and I mean a lot) maybe more than you probably eat now and still maintain or lose weight.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whenever I go out to eat with others, they ask me if I have a hollow leg. \u00a0Really? \u00a0I wish. \u00a0I don't have a hollow leg and I wasn't blessed with a high metabolism either. \u00a0My mother tells me \" You were born the big boned one in the family\" (thanks mom). In fact, does anyone really have a high metabolism anyways?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, there are some exceptions to the rule but when it comes right down to it, we either eat too much or we don't. \u00a0You know, \u00a0the old calories in calories out kind of thing or, the magic of it all, we don't eat the right food combinations which is limiting.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Working out is good but not as important as what you eat. \u00a0If all we needed to do to stay thin was to work out \u00a0thirty minutes to an hour per day then we could eat all the food we wanted right? Wrong. \u00a0Not even athletes can do this.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing is that it's the type of food and in what combinations that we eat. \u00a0Going back to my business partner, a chicken fried steak paired with mash potatoes, that will put weight on us. Not to mention that, the side effects of that type of food is probably not good for our health.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, this blog post is not about lecturing anyone on the ways to eat for better health (although eating this way will make you more healthy). \u00a0 Nope, this blog post is about showing you the ways that you can eat a ton of food, never be hungry and most importantly, satisfy your taste buds.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's face it, no one likes to eat boring food or starve themselves. \u00a0Honestly, when I don't eat a lot, I'm a bit grouchy and no one likes a grouch. \u00a0I could never just not eat because my stomach hurts and I get a little spacey. \u00a0There is no way. \u00a0I\u00a0love people and food too much because, food should be enjoyed. \u00a0No one ever had fun while out to dinner with someone who pretends not to be hungry.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are all hungry and we all pretty much love food. \u00a0Why fight it!

Shouldn\u2019t they be first or at least near first?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Whatever products you use, you need to use them for at least one month to see genuine results.\u00a0 Many products claim to reduce lines and wrinkles but just add moisture to the skin thus, plumping up the lines and wrinkles giving you the APPEARANCE of them being gone.\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>I don\u2019t like the word appearance! I would rather the claim say that it get's rid of them!! Not just the look of them..<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was watching an infomercial about crepey skin (you know when our skin begins to look like tissue paper as we get older?)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I spent too much time in the sun in my younger days and now, I seem to be losing lasticity. \u00a0I would love a product to tighten my skin but really, is a product going to do this? No.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The product was some cream that I would put on my legs and then my legs would become firm and smooth. Yeah right! \u00a0I think exercise does this..<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The great thing about knowing what the secret to beauty products are and knowing how to read the ingredient labels is that, when you want to buy a new beauty product, you can simply go online, Google it, and then read what is in it and verify if the active ingredients are there.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I researched the product for for my legs and it turns out that the active ingredient was almost at the last on the list and the rest was a filler product of shea butter. \u00a0That's it!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I saved about $100.00 by not buying this product and instead I went out and bought some shea butter and it's doing a good job. Turns out, I need more moisture on my legs and to workout!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The takeaway here is to save money and to not buy into beauty claims and products that are not true and that won't work.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all have a grave yard full of these..<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCheck out my free \"2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula\" \u00a0It's the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks! \u00a0Down load it right here:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ztxw2xk\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ztxw2xk<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7336\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2-693x1024-203x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"203\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">age spots<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">beauty products<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">cosmetic surgery<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to look younger<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">skin care<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">smooth skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">tighter skin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">wrinkles<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/32004867_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":695,"slug":"plastic-surgery-makes-you-look-older","type":"post","title":"Plastic surgery makes you look older","content":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Plastic surgery makes you look older<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can't help but notice a lot of celebrities getting plastic surgery and, they not only look a little odd but, they look older than they were in the first place.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In my book \"Where Women Go\" I talk about if getting plastic surgery or cosmetic procedures, to do it gradually. \u00a0Don't wake up one day and think, damn! I need to do whole bunch of stuff to my face because, you won't look younger, you will look done!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm not saying that if you want plastic surgery or cosmetic procedures that you shouldn't. \u00a0Let's face it, unfortunately, we live in a world where it seems that women over fifty disappear.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We live under the pressure to not only look good but, look younger for our age.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am a woman who uses Botox<strong><sup>\u2122<\/sup><\/strong>, works out, injects filler now and again, and uses the best skin care creams that my budget allows.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, there comes a time when you begin to see changes in your body, face, and skin that no creams, fillers or injections will ever change.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing is, now that I am turning 50 in two months, I have a little more money to do some cosmetic procedures but the question is, should I?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do we all get to the fork in the road at a certain age and then, we go the surgery route or the natural aging route?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For some, it may be just a matter of aging gracefully and for those, I so admire you and wish that I could just be content and go with the flow.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing that gets to me the most is, when I walk into a room, it's like I'm not even there. \u00a0I know I'm there but no one else does.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With that said, it's starting to be okay because I'm finally accepting that I am, and I will, continue to age.

Premature ventricular contractions are premature because they occur before the regular heartbeat.\"<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I found this out because I was going to have a minor cosmetic procedure and the doctor did an EKG and it came back abnormal. &nbsp;She said that she wouldn't do the procedure until I got a heart doctor to clear me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, after thousands of dollars to satisfy my deductible, I had a stress test, a heart halter monitor, more EKG's, a Nuclear heart test (radio active dye put in my veins), and an echocardiogram, and a few other tests.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I went' to my \"Natural OBGYN\" to tell her that every since she put me on thyroid medicine, I could feel my heart palpitating. &nbsp;She took blood, I went back and she said, it was not the thyroid medicine but that my heart issue was just part of aging.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With sadness, I took her words and thankfully&nbsp;my heart came back normal. &nbsp;I got my clearance from the heart doctor and I got my procedure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the next year or so, I went back four times to tell my OBGYN that there was something wrong with my heart. &nbsp;She couldn't find anything.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I decided to get another opinion and went to an Endocrinologist and he said that I should stay on the thyroid medicine because he said my blood level was normal and now found a nodule on my thyroid meaning, my thyroid was attacking itself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I Got the nodule tested and it too was fine.&nbsp;So, I took more thyroid medicine. I felt like I was on diet pills, my heart felt like it was jumping out of my chest and, I felt bad all of the time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was close to accepting living this way. &nbsp;Until, I needed another minor surgery and the anesthesiologist decided to give me yet, another EKG because, by now I was on blood pressure medication because of my heart rate and, my PVC'S were twice as bad as the time before.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She said she would not put me under and said again that I needed heart clearance. They pulled the I'V'S out and after losing my payment to secure the surgery, I was again, spinning trying to figure out what to do next.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After getting dressed and being kindly told not to come back until I could figure out my health issue, I sadly walked to my car.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I called my OBGYN in the parking lot and she said come right over and get my thyroid tested. &nbsp;By now, I was tired of playing this game. &nbsp;I decided she was the problem and that I needed to find a way to get off of thyroid medication. &nbsp;She actually wanted me to take more as she said I was even on the low end!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I almost cried because I thought for a second that maybe my heart was failing and my life would end up being short. &nbsp;I recently lost my brother to the side effects of radiation near his heart and I concluded that I would be next.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After all, I am going to be 50 in a couple of months and they say that heart disease is the number one killer of women over 50. &nbsp;I thought it was just my fate and I was going to have to live with a bad heart valve or something.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I did get another blood test and took it to a new endocrinologist. &nbsp;He said as soon as I told him the symptoms and what I was taking, he told me the problem was the name brand \"Armour\" and that it was made from pigs and that, sometimes we can't handle pig thyroid.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said in some people it causes an electrical arrhythmia. &nbsp;He might as well have said \"Theresa, your hell is over and you've been saved.\"<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, I'm 90% Vegan which goes against me taking pig medicine but I'm also 100% proactive in my health and I know my body.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doctor also said that, every dose is a different dose meaning that, it comes from different pigs so my body has an issue with it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don't know how many times I asked my \"Natural OBGYN\" to think about switching my brand. &nbsp;Nope!

Does he really like you or does he have someone else?\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to tell her what I really thought and that was that he probably liked her but, he either didn't wan't a relationship with her or that, he does have another person he is seeing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So I told her to move on because if someone is not giving you what you need and moreover, when your intuition is asking you questions, then you already know the answer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was thinking about making this blog post about dating at middle-age and how difficult it is but then, I thought that, it's really not so much about age is it? \u00a0I think this question can come up at any age.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When someone is not in to you or they have other issues in their lives, it's not hard to take it personally especially when you really like someone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think the middle-age part comes in when you are limited in the people that are available to date or mostly likely, the ways to meet people to date. \u00a0Where do people that are over 50 meet these days? \u00a0Dating websites? \u00a0If so, and you've honestly found a good guy, please, email me at theresaskrobanek@yahoo.com to tell me your story. \u00a0I would love to share it with other women :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So when you do find someone that you like and who makes you feel wanted but something is not right, sometimes you don't want to listen to your inner voice telling you the truth. \u00a0And sometimes that truth is saying \"move on because you deserve better.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it that he's just not that into you? \u00a0Truthfully, who cares? \u00a0It's not your problem.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We only have so much time and if we waste it wondering and worrying about someone else having the ability to direct our lives, including our loves lives, then we are losing valuable time that could be used as open space for someone that does really love you. You can't find that person if you're tied up trying to change someone who will never be with you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm not a relationship expert and really, is there such a thing? \u00a0Everyone is vulnerable and that's the great thing. \u00a0It's good to give 100% percent of yourself to someone. If they take advantage of it, it's not your fault. \u00a0Just like if someone cheats, it's an issue with themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now-a-days, it seems like people and relationship are disposable so that, with all of the technology, we can unlike, unfriend or block someone is a split second.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like they say, \"if it doesn't come easy, it's not worth having?\" Well, I know there are things in life you have to work for but, in the beginning of a relationship if you have ask questions such as my friend did then, I believe that you will ask these questions the entire time that you in the relationship and, this is an indicator that the relationship won't last therefore, why waste time and just move on.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you really care if he likes you?<\/p>\r\n<em>\u00a0<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Dating<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Dating<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">dating<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">Do you really care if he likes you?how to find a good man<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">find love<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to find and keep a man<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">love<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">relationship<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/44971454_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":372,"slug":"audio-post-type","type":"post","title":"i love organic food!","content":"Duis autem eum iriure dolor in hendrerit vulputate velit molestieconsequat vel illum dolor vel mazim placerat facer Duis autem","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">Business<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/1-624x624.jpg"},{"id":636,"slug":"look-younger-for-less-money","type":"post","title":"Look Younger For Less Money","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Look Younger For Less Money<\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Basic cosmetic procedures that are the least expensive and would be a natural progression after skin care. Compared to products, cosmetic procedures are not a commodity so finding bargain cosmetic procedures may not be a good thing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We\u2019re talking about wounding the skin, and this doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with cheaper. However, there is no reason you can\u2019t call around to your local dermatologists or plastic surgeons to find out what the procedures cost.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then you can compare for yourself. I pick three or four good doctors or medical spas in my area and check their prices, and then I get on their email list. Before long, I get discounted offers of up to thirty percent off their procedures.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s worth it to compare and get on their lists. You\u2019ll get weekly emails from all the places you signed up at to compare the prices. You can even call your favorite doctor or spa and ask if they will match prices. They do it all the time!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Botox<\/strong><\/em> - You should get Botox as a prevention measure. You may only need ten units or so just to prevent frown lines or lines that may be forming between your nose and eyes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can also have Botox used on your crow\u2019s feet (the lines around your eyes). This helps tremendously. If you need thirty or forty units and you can\u2019t afford it all at once, then get ten units every few weeks until you get all areas covered.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cost varies, but I have paid up to fourteen-dollars a unit. When I got on the doctors\u2019 or Spa lists, I received discounts and now I only pay about nine to ten dollars per unit. That\u2019s a pretty good savings. Some doctors will have a buy two get one free promotion.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, there are competing products to Botox. Because they\u2019re competing with Botox, they may be less money. Botox, which is owned by Allergen, has a loyalty program, as well. I recently received a coupon for $100 off the total cost of my Botox!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This program is called BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS. Make sure you sign up or have your doctor\/injector sign you up and every time you get Botox or another Allergan product such as Juvederm, etc. you will receive points towards your next service.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I almost got my most recent Botox for free!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Chemical Peel<\/strong><\/em> - A chemical peel is great for removing the surface layer of the skin. The process wounds the skin, which causes it to heal itself by creating new collagen. A chemical peel has different strengths so the cost will vary.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In most states, a chemical peel will cost about $150 to \u00a0$200 in a doctor\u2019s office. You\u2019ll want to continue having peels, as they will help create beautiful skin with less texture and, diminish fine lines.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can do them yourself, but start with a low strength. \u00a0Unfortunately, in my learning process, I bought a thirty-percent TCA peel online (I should not have been able to purchase this strength peel without a license), and I did some serious damage to my skin. Damage so bad that, I have to hide the scars every day of my life. It\u2019s not the worth the risk to try and skip ahead rather than to start slow or let a professional do it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to do your own peel, start with a small patch of skin to see how it will react. I do my own peels every two to four weeks, usually no more than twice a month. You can go to <em><strong>skin-peel.com<\/strong><\/em> to find them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>The secret to making peels comfortable is while they are on your face, use your blow dryer on the cool setting or, use a small hand fan pointed at your face. It makes a difference.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Retin-A<\/strong><\/em> - A prescription is required, but Retin-A is fantastic!! \u201cRetin-A (tretinoin) is a topical preparation of vitamin A, which has antioxidant properties, just like the vitamin by itself. It\u2019s an acid derivative of retinol (vitamin A).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The important aspect is really the effectiveness of what Retin-A does. Studies have shown that Retin-A can help reduce wrinkles, reduce acne, exfoliate dead skin cells and redistribute melanin. Melanin redistribution results in lighter, more even skin color. Thus Retin-A is often used to treat skin discolorations caused by excessive sun exposure.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have sensitive skin, it may not work for you, it may be too harsh, but there are alternatives with lesser concentrations. \u00a0I would still try to mix a little every other night in my favorite cream. Just don\u2019t give up. This stuff is amazing!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Get this for less at canadianpharmacy.com.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Teeth Whitening<\/strong><\/em> - This makes a huge difference. You could have perfect skin and straight teeth, but if your teeth are stained and dull, no one will notice. If you have bright, white teeth, you\u2019ll look better, and younger, and feel better too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cost in my state is about $50.00, which is down from $500 when I first had it done. There are many good ones over the counter too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IPL-, which stands for intense pulse light or flash lamp therapy, is a noninvasive and non-ablative treatment that uses high intensity pulses of visible light to improve the appearance of birth marks, port wine stains, broken facial veins, rosy cheeks, rosacea, red thread veins of the legs, freckles, age spots, facial lines and wrinkles, and the removal of unwanted dark hair. The procedure is referred to as photo rejuvenation and requires a series of treatments.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cost nationally runs about $300 to $400. You should only need a few treatments. I have seen it as low as $150 per treatment if you agree to three or more.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just a quick note: I have been using a product called Black Magic Tattoo remover (it\u2019s a small handheld pulse light machine) to remove a lot of my brown spots on my arms and legs.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It works the same as an IPL machine. \u00a0I got it on Amazon.com however, it takes time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wouldn\u2019t use the machine on my face though. It\u2019s important to know that brown spots on the body are very hard to remove. The light process takes time. I also add a skin bleach and put a little of my skin peel on each spot too when I do peels on my face.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dermapen or Micro-Needling \u2013 \u201c Sterile surgical stainless micro-needles pierce the skin leading to apoptosis of cells in the dermis.\u201d \u201cWhat is Apoptosis? Apoptosis or programmed cell death, is when a cell essentially commits suicide. This process is natural, controlled and routine. Little inflammation is caused.\u201d \u201cThe Dermapen uses eleven, 33-gauge micro needles to stimulate the dermis. Needles vertically pierce the skin to enhance rejuvenation results. Small holes are punctured at a rate of 1000\/second.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">This proliferation of the body\u2019s tissue continues to release growth factors from fibroblasts, keratinocytes and monocytes.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Note: I have had <strong><em>Dermapen<\/em><\/strong> about six times and it works wonders. It\u2019s comparable to lasers like Fraxel but without all the down time and expense. Many doctor\u2019s will give you a discount if you buy a package of four or more. You can save hundreds by doing this. I paid $150 per treatment vs. $300 - $350 by buying the package. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\"><em><strong>Juvederm<\/strong><\/em> - Juvederm is an injectable filler consisting mostly of hyaluronic acid. It\u2019s used to fill in areas to smooth out wrinkles and deep folds on the face, and can last up to a year. You can pay anywhere from $400 a syringe to $800. I pay only about $400 - $450 depending on the specials the doctors have. Currently, my doctor has buy one get one free, and I can save the second one for a later time.

We have all seen it, or maybe we have been troubled by the changes we\u2019re seeing in our own skin. Thin skin, sagging, dullness, lines and wrinkles (sorry, I had to remind you).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, it happens to everyone at some time. For many of us, we want to look as young as we feel, however, sometimes the outside is not so accommodating to the inside. As we age, especially starting in our thirties and forties, our hormones begin to decline and then diminish over time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because of this, our skin becomes fragile, thin, wrinkled and, sags. If you have gone through menopause than you should know that it\u2019s been stated that, we will lose thirty percent of our skin\u2019s collagen in the first five years after menopause! Ouch! You can counter this effect! We can use oral hormones or hormone creams (prescribed by a doctor) to increase collagen support.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I personally, am not one for taking synthetic hormones, as I believe there is an increased risk of breast cancer and other harmful effects. I use a bioidentical hormone cream prescribed by my doctor.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Does it help my skin? I like to think so. For me, it\u2019s been an accumulative effect of bio-identical hormones, peels, topical retinoid, vitamin C serums, sunscreen, supplements, exercising and a semi-clean diet that keeps me and my skin balanced.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s important to have your hormones tested routinely, as you want to keep your hormones balanced. I was skeptical at first going on a bio-identical hormone treatment, as I thought if I did, I\u2019d get cancer. Because of reading and hearing that hormones cause cancer (in the wrong context), I fought taking them! Eventually, I opened up my mind and learned just the opposite.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: All hormone replacement therapy has some cancer risks. However, if monitored, these can be minimized.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to many doctors and research, balancing our hormones keeps us from getting cancer instead of the reverse. In fact, it\u2019s having very little hormones that may cause cancer in the first place or, at least can contribute to it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As I said, I personally would not take oral hormones, but that\u2019s just me and you have to make an educated decision based on what is right for you. At the very least, it\u2019s good to see where your levels are. Okay, back to my point. When you let your hormones fluctuate, it can have a negative impact on your skin. The bottom line is to get your hormones tested and get them balanced, if even just for a better quality of health and skin.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCheck out my free \"2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula\" It's the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!

As people want less invasive<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">beauty procedures they are turning more toward anti-aging products that work well and<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">that really change their skin.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Time spent on personal appearance takes on added importance as we age. Men and<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">women want to retain the looks they had when they were younger. Of course, we can\u2019t<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">go back, but we can age gracefully.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the short-term, we\u2019ll spend money on anti-aging products that we hope will prevent us<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">from having cosmetic surgery procedures. We\u2019ll spend money on anti-aging products<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">that counter the visible signs of aging, thus, as we age, our spending will intensify.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the long-term, we\u2019ll either have to face the effects of aging skin or give into the<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">cosmetic procedures we had once hoped to avoid. By using effective anti-aging<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">products, we can prolong the need for cosmetic surgery and hopefully, get to a place<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">where it\u2019s not as important as it once was.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The revolutionizing factor is technology. Technology will create more effective products<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">that penetrate the skin rather than sit on top of it. We already have products that use<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">nanotechnology, where the molecules are so small the delivery system is able to deeply<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">penetrate the skin, thus, delivering the optimal amount of ingredients that effectively<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">make a difference to our skin. In the future, we will use one product with all the<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">capabilities of many products, instead of the three or four currently sitting on our<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">shelves.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this time, knowing that taking care of your skin before it becomes damaged by FREE<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RADICALS, such as the environment and the sun, is the best defense. However, if<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">you\u2019re like me and have damaged skin from too much sun exposure, and you\u2019re now<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">concerned with how to reverse the damage, I\u2019ll show you how. I call this, \u201cReverse Engineering your skin.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all know that as we age our skin becomes dull and tired. We are at the mercy of our environment and how well we take care of our skin.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are a variety of reasons our skin ages faster than we\u2019d like and many are due to our lifestyle, diet, heredity, the environment and, our daily habits.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. The loss of skin elasticity (wrinkles, sagging).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Loss of volume (collagen).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Bone changes (the bones become thinner).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all age at different rates. Some of us require surgical intervention sooner than others. In general, we all end up aging about the same. Some of the aging issues that many of us also deal with are thickening texture, thinning skin, dryness, and, brown spots.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The changes that occur below the skin, such as fat loss, bone loss, and cartridge loss at the nose, among other factors, can only be fixed with fillers and fat transfer. Contrary to what cosmetic companies want us to believe, there isn\u2019t a topical product that will create and make a difference in volume.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, products like Retin-A will help, as it stimulates collagen, but it won\u2019t make significant volume changes like fillers or fat transfer. Retin-A is more for texture and exfoliating as it helps create new skin faster.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smoking is an absolute skin ager, no matter what age you are and, it only gets worse with time. Facial movement causes lines that become visible after the skin starts losing its elasticity. As people reach their thirties and forties, lines will \u201cappear horizontally on the forehead, vertically on the skin above the root of the nose (glabella), or as small curved lines on the temples, upper cheeks and around the mouth.\u201d(webmd.com\/effects of aging of the skin).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, as you can see, it doesn\u2019t look good for our skin as we age, however, with prevention starting in our twenties and beyond we can create a more youthful appearance by using products with ingredients that actually work. But what about now, you might ask? What about if you are forty and over? \u201cWhat can we do now?\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In my next post, I will show you how to look younger..<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check out my free \"2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula\" It's the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!

But, is fish really healthy?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fish has vitamins A, B12, D, choline, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids and additional minerals like, zinc, iron selenium and magnesium.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So why wouldn't we eat fish instead of red meat? \u00a0With all of it's vitamins and minerals and, lean protein, fish looks like a good alternative to red meat right?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is that fish may be posing health threats and, the risk of eating it may outweigh the benefit.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because fish travel in the water they ingest the toxins in the water. With that, fish are commonly contaminated in a soup of waste like, PCBs, pesticides, insecticides, industrial waste, lead, and mercury.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I could continue this list however, I'm actually feeling a little sick to my stomach while writing this post because, I was a Vegan and Vegetarian for twenty plus years and, a few years ago I switched to fish. \u00a0Right now, I'm not liking what I'm finding out.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I didn't wan't do any research on eating fish because I didn't want to know the truth. \u00a0If I did, like I'm writing about today, I would have stopped eating fish. \u00a0I thought, so long as I ate wild and not farm raised fish, I was good.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fish, animals, and humans, accumulate toxins in their fatty tissue. \u00a0The larger the fish, the most vulnerable we are because they eat smaller fish and the concentrations could be thousands of times greater.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is what Dr. Timothy J. Smith said about eating fish:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You've heard of Russian roulette? I call this ocean roulette. \u00a0And you play ever time you put fish on your plate.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A quick reference on how fish become contaminated:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fish live in coastal waters, usually near large cities, these cities dump high amounts of toxins and billions of chemicals and these chemicals get passed along to us humans. \u00a0I can go into all of the ways that these chemicals are effecting our health but, you get the point by now.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to farm raised fish, the reason that they are not healthier is because the water they swim in is also contaminated by pesticides and herbicides from runoff.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back to the wild fish. \u00a0Wild fish may be safer to eat because they live in cold water which is further away from cities (coastal waters). \u00a0However, it doesn't guarantee how safe they are to eat.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To make matters worse, preservatives are another problem with fish. \u00a0Fisherman add them to fish while in travel so they won't spoil or rot.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's unfortunate that we humans have to ruin food like fish because what fish does provide is a powerful Omega-3 benefit. \u00a0The omega-3 fatty acids have the ability to protect against heart disease, prevent blood clots, reduce triglycerides, reduce inflammation, help with arthritis, and, even help with mental health functioning.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Okay, here's the kicker and the last of my bad news about eating fish because, well, what else is there left to say?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another quote from Dr. Timothy J.

\u00a0And when I say gift, I mean art, our God given talent or, the reason that we were put on this earth.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think that most of us have an idea about what we love to do or at least, we have some things that we are interested in however, way too many times, we are preoccupied by ourselves calling it a job, life, or whatever. \u00a0Unfortunately, we never get to fulfill our true calling when we don't actively seek our gift and embrace it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With anxiety disorder, we're not worried about our God given gift but, more worried that we will get into situations that will cause us to panic.\u00a0What does having a gift have anything to do with anxiety?\u00a0 Well, it does and here\u2019s my philosophy on why.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many people are in prison because they either didn\u2019t find out what their gift was or they never did do anything with the gift they were given.\u00a0 The gift I\u2019m talking about is each persons creativity that\u2019s locked up inside of us until we find it and set it free to light a fire in our soul.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, some people know what their gift is and it's easy for them. \u00a0Some of us have to struggle to find it. \u00a0Doesn't matter though, so long as we do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019m not talking about painting a Picasso picture or some abstract art.\u00a0 Although if that\u2019s it for you, then what are you waiting for?\u00a0 What I\u2019m talking about here is something that motivates you and you're passionate about. Don't ever underestimate passion. \u00a0It will free your soul.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of us think it\u2019s not possible to have a passion or to even begin to figure out what that is but, I can tell you that anxiety is a fear and it\u2019s a fear of many things and, fear robs of us of all the possibilities\u00a0that are waiting for us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What if you replaced fear and anxiety with a passion and a purpose?\u00a0 It makes a huge difference in your life because instead of worrying about a situation in the future, you are constantly thinking about your passion as it consumes your mind. \u00a0You think of ways to expand and you'll see the world as an inspiration to fuel the art that's inside of you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me give you an example of one type of art other than the traditional ones that we all think of.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Writing is my art.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even imagine going a day without writing because I love it.\u00a0 I carry a note pad around and at least several times a day, I'm writing down book ideas and inspirational ideas. \u00a0I get these ideas because I am open to my passion and my passion feeds itself with possibility\u00a0instead of negativity.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once I found what is was that I was completely and utterly passionate about, the anxiety that I suffered from for longer than I care to admit, quietly disappeared.\u00a0 In fact, it went away\u00a0and\u00a0I transitioned from the anxiety screaming in my brain each day to most days not even hearing the voice at all.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How does one find their art? To start, it\u2019s the ability to see things differently than the rest. Each one of us sees the world different than the other and each one of us can use this as a reference to find our passion. \u00a0Don't fit into a mold because you are different and it's the only way to find how unique you are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Find the source of creativity at the same place as you find resistance.\u00a0 Stop resisting and allow yourself to be open and your passion will have room to enter.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Takeaway #1 - Decide for the rest of your life to commit to finding what your passion is and replace anxiety with it.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Overcome Anxiety Part #1<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!

That's just not me. \u00a0The only thing that had changed was me thinking I didn't need my thyroid therapy. \u00a0When I got back on it, my mood was back to my happy self again. \u00a0Placebo? \u00a0I don't think so. \u00a0I need thyroid medicine whether I like it or not.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course you will need a blood test to determine what your hormone levels are. \u00a0It's almost certain that, if you are in middle-age and beyond, you will need to balance your hormones.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's true that\u00a0medical experts disagree about the significance of a Testosterone decline, and whether the health benefits of HRT outweigh the risks.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">HRT (hormone replacement therapy) is something you will have to carefully consider for yourself and whether it's right for you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you decide to do HRT, please be careful to work with your doctor and not with some unknown source on the internet. \u00a0It only takes the smallest amount of hormones to be effective, conversely, the same is true for damage to be done too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, if you do HRT, try and do natural hormones. \u00a0I do bio-identical which are made by a Compound Pharmacist. \u00a0It's important to know that, just because it's a natural hormone doesn't mean that it's without risk.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here's a little side note that my doctor told me. \u00a0When I was worried about taking hormones because of a breast cancer risk or any cancer risk whatsoever, she said \"Theresa, you have more of a risk for cancer by not balancing your hormones.\" \u00a0I'm putting my faith in my doctor and in my research.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It makes sense because the longer we live the more exposure we have to the things that cause cancer right? So, if we keep our hormones balanced (they make the biggest decisions for our body) then wouldn't it be true that without them, we have less of a fighting chance.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Hormones<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Hormones<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">cancer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">DHEA<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">estrogen<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">hormone replacement therapy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to lose weight<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to lose weight fast<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">HRT<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">melatonin<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">progesteronE<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">testosterone<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">The 4 Crucial Anti-Aging Hormones<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">thyroid<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/9914669_s-380x280.jpg"},{"id":539,"slug":"natural-hormone-replacement","type":"post","title":"Do you need natural hormone replacement?","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Do you need natural hormone replacement?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Does natural hormone replacement have the ability to keep us youthful and disease free for life?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormones are substances naturally produced by components of the endocrine gland, ovaries, testicles, pituitary, pineal gland, \u00a0and thyroid. \u00a0Levels change and influence the aging process.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormone replacement can turn back the clock if the levels are stabilized which gives us leverage in our bid for anti-aging.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormones are different from vitamins and minerals because hormones regulate the metabolic activity in our bodies. \u00a0While vitamins and minerals do the rest of the work. Hormones make all the big decisions in our bodies and they are effective in small numbers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Correcting hormone deficiencies can play a huge role in our health and in our longevity. The key is to detect and correct hormones successfully. \u00a0Hormones can actually reverse many of the mental and physical changes that we see as normal aging.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example hormone replacement therapy can help with the immune system, brittle bones, muscles loss, memory, insomnia, fatigue, loss of libido, and a lot more.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormones help the body become healthier and heal faster so that we can live a better life and live a longer life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When they say \"hormone replacement\" they don't mean that all of a sudden you no longer have any hormones circulating through your blood. \u00a0What is meant is that, our bodies are making fewer hormones as we age. \u00a0In our thirties the decline begins to take place.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Did you know that the gradual deterioration in hormone reduction is already programmed in our genes? As hormones slow down, aging speeds up. \u00a0The rate of reduction usually equals the rate of aging.<\/p>\r\nHere are the hormones I'm talking about:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Melatonin<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone<\/li>\r\n \t<li>DHEA<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Pregnenolone<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Thyroid<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we restore these hormones, hopefully at the level of when we were younger, we can slow down or dare I say it \"<strong>reverse the aging process<\/strong>?\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each type of hormone is specific. \u00a0Currently, I am on a small dose of estrogen, a testosterone cream, melatonin, and thyroid hormone. \u00a0Do I feel great? \u00a0I'd like to think so. I'm pushing fifty in a couple of months so, yes, I would like to reverse or at the very least, keep disease away.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the next post, I will breakdown the above five hormones and how they work. \u00a0I will also tell you how you can get tested and what synthetic hormones verses hormones means.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Until then, I will ask you. \u00a0Have you ever had your hormones tested?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check out my free \"2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula\" It's the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!

If we live long enough, most of will get cancer right?\u00a0Wrong!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trying to rationalize our bad habits will contribute to us getting cancer. \u00a0\"I may as well eat whatever I want because we're all going to die anyways\" is what I heard from a friend at lunch today. \u00a0This got me thinking about how we ourselves may actually be contributing to cancer by trying to rationalize our bad habits.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In no way am I blaming anyone for getting cancer here. \u00a0Cancer is a terrible thing and I have lost loved ones to cancer and it kills my heart when I hear of anyone being diagnosed. \u00a0With all of the money that we have poured into trying to find a cure, it doesn't seem that we're even close. \u00a0To me it just doesn't make sense.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe you have cancer genes (genetics) and you have many family members who had cancer in each generation and you think that you may be genetically programmed to get it too. \u00a0Although we can't change our genetic makeup, heredity isn't everything either.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am not a doctor but I do know from the research that I have done when my younger brother had cancer that, lifestyle choices may determine whether we express or turn on the cancer gene in the first place.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The point here is that, if cancer runs in your family, lifestyle choices and prevention could be the thing that keeps the genes from turning on and causing cancer. \u00a0Of course there are too many times where someone could do everything perfect and have all the money in the world to fight it and, it's still something their body was going to do. \u00a0Breast cancer comes to mind when I think about this statement.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>What causes cancer? \u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm going to give my non doctor version here. \u00a0Cancer is a disease made up of an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Somewhere along the way, the immune system gets into trouble or collapses and left alone it can cause chaos.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A healthy cell gets attacked by a free radical and then damages the DNA causing cancer (remember this is the non-doctor version here). \u00a0The cell get's reprogrammed and unless the DNA is quickly repaired then, well, the cell will never be the same.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cancer takes some time as it doesn't happen over night. \u00a0It goes through initiation, promotion and then progresses. \u00a0I have also found in my research that once its detected, it has doubled approximately 30 times and has about a billion cells.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Did you know that cancer is always being created in our bodies and its also always being destroyed? \u00a0It's when we have too many free radicals and not enough anti-oxidants to zap them is when our immune system runs amok.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are tests that you can get from specialized doctors and one is to check your levels of oxidative stress. \u00a0This is a blood panel that measures three levels of free radical activity. \u00a0I won't go into all the things that are tested because it's pretty extensive however, talk to your doctor if you want to get this blood test as it shows where free radicals are punching holes in your antioxidant armor and, when that happens, you can get cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the results your doctor can put you on a good supplement and diet program to hopefully reduce inflammation which seems to trigger the beginning. \u00a0I'm not saying that when one has cancer that supplements and diet are the cure (it certainly is good for you) but, what I am saying is that, if you could prevent it before it happens with these things, then who knows?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>What prevents cancer?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So our body prevents cancer in two ways. \u00a0First, it helps prevent cancer cells from forming and then it removes those cells that slip past our defense system.\u00a0These are systems such as DNA repair, antioxidants, enzymes, immune support, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's important to keep our immune system in the best possible condition so that it can perform the necessary tasks of destroying cells before they become defective.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Immune health is crucial to cancer prevention and our longevity. If we minimize our exposure to immune suppressing factors like pollution, bad fats, sugar, pesticides, toxins, hormones, radiation, etc. then our immune system will have a chance to protect us back.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCheck out my free \"2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula\" It's the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!

If we don't clean it out, we increase the workload for the kidneys, liver and colon. \u00a0These three organs are responsible for cleansing our bodies.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was a Vegan for almost twenty years, now I eat a bit of fish and some dairy. \u00a0So basically, I'm not defined as even a Vegetarian, even though 95% of my diet is fruits and vegetables. Maybe I have conditioned myself to think this way but, I can't go without a ton of vegetables daily. \u00a0I absolutely crave them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This blog post isn't about converting anyone into being a vegetarian nor is it about all of the reasons that meat is bad for you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's about telling you how you\u00a0can have an alternative to meat sometimes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So when I was a Vegan, people would always ask me \"how do you get your protein?\" I heard this all the time! \u00a0The bottom line is that meat promotes the aging process and you can get all of your protein from other healthier sources such as plant proteins that are better for your body.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grains, fruits, beans, and vegetables are naturally low in protein. \u00a0By eating them in combinations your body gets a balanced supply of amino acids without risking a protein overload, because, more protein is not better for your body.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While animal protein raises cholesterol, vegetable proteins have been shown to lower cholesterol. \u00a0Also, there is a higher amount of calcium in plant protein which gets absorbed into your bones to be stored rather than being neutralized by amino acids from meat. So it's probably wise to say that as we get older, meat contributes to poor skeletal health and more importantly, may contribute to osteoporosis.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not counting soy, no single plant food supplies a complete protein. \u00a0Meaning that, no plant provides all eight amino acids needed for our body. \u00a0 Even one amino acid deficiency is enough to stop our cells from gathering or assembling all the proteins needed for our bodies to grow and heal. \u00a0This is what's meant when we hear about cells building proteins by joining amino acids to form chains.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here's a quick overview of why you might consider adding plant based foods to your diet:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li>Grains and beans are complementary plant proteins.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Contrary to common belief, you don't have to have have complementary proteins at the same time or same meal.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Feed your body a variety of of complementary plant proteins on a regular basis therefore, you will optimize all of the amino acids you'll need.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Plant based foods are a way for your body to renew itself.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Plants are low in fat, high in minerals, vitamins, phyto-chemicals, and fiber.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You won't get protein overload which hurts your body over time.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One note to mention here. \u00a0Be careful of where you buy your plants as most are corrupted with pesticides and chemicals that can do more harm than good.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can spend money on your health now by prevention, thus buying organic or spend your money on managing your health later when it may be too late.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, organic food costs more and that's really unfortunate that we have to pay more money to eat cleaner food. \u00a0I say shame on the food industry however, for the time being, it is what it is and unless you wan't to grow your own (and good for you if you do), then, buy organic so that your organs don't have to be overloaded by cleaning your food.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DO YOU REALLY NEED TO EAT MEAT?<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCheck out my free \"2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula\" It's the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!

Changes occur all around us and there is nothing we can do about it. Sometimes change is good and sometimes, as we feel change, it may be uncomfortable, so we resist it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even after all the resisting we do, there comes a time when we are ready for a change. When we accept it, we listen to our inner self, possibly the one that has been talking to us our whole lives, but only now are we listening.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s the voice that we have always wanted to hear, but didn\u2019t take its advice until now. It\u2019s time for a change and with change comes healing and transformation.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Transformation is growth and with growth comes the ability to release the past, the pain, and accept what the future will bring. Many of us make New Year\u2019s resolutions and most of us break them.<span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">I know I do within the first week, so I stopped making them. Do we really need the start of a new year to change something we don\u2019t like?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The key to making a change is wanting to do it. Even if we fail on our journey, the more we keep trying, the greater the chance is that we will succeed. I don\u2019t need a diet to deprive myself. As soon as I say diet, I get a negative emotion that pulls me in the opposite direction and I automatically go right back to the way I was or sometimes worse.<span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">I get the opposite reaction. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Instead of feeling pleasure I feel pain, and this is what I focus on. I realize that I don\u2019t need to constantly live like this. The fact is, I don\u2019t need to diet; I just need to eat better. We as a society put so many restrictions on ourselves and when we don\u2019t succeed we punish ourselves and the cycle continues. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">I need to make a lifestyle change, that\u2019s all. If you want to make a change, make a change, but don\u2019t do it because of others. You know what will and will not make you a better person. This is the only change we really need to make.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no one solution for change. Everyone is different and it is through trial and error that we succeed. I tend to go in circles when I don\u2019t know how to make a change. This wastes so much time that I often stop trying and start again later, only to go in circles again.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once I fall, I know why I fell and I don\u2019t fall that way again. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I fall and sometimes many times, but eventually, I learn what doesn\u2019t work even if only by default and I succeed in the end. It\u2019s the only way I know how. No sense in kicking ourselves when we are down. It doesn\u2019t make sense to be defeated before we start. I have wasted a lot of time in my life, not by trying and falling and trying again, nope, I have wasted more time not doing anything at all.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are sitting on the fence or the couch for that matter and you know it\u2019s time for a change, what are you waiting for?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Momentum kicks in in any situation when we get started. Think about when you were in school and you had a term paper due. You may have been the kid who waited until the last minute because you didn\u2019t have a topic and you didn\u2019t know where to begin. Painfully, you waited until the last minute and got started the night before or the morning that it was due.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s not so much that time isn\u2019t on your side, its momentum that kicks in and you get on a roll. Once you are at this phase, you are blowing and going and you see the end in sight. It\u2019s just like change. You realize that it\u2019s not so hard and wonder why you didn\u2019t do it sooner. We make things harder than they need to be.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are also elements of change. We need to understand there are several factors involved in changing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Readiness, barriers and relapse should all be expected on the road to change. We only make change when we are ready to. I want my mom to stop smoking and take care of herself, but she is not ready to and at seventy-one, she probably never will be.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\"> I can\u2019t do anything about it, only accept it, and she has to own it and pay the consequences. I spent a lot of years trying to get her and others to change for the better and I always met with resistance. It wasn\u2019t until I came to terms with the truth that no one will ever change unless they want to, not because I wanted them to. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Why I needed someone to be other than who they wanted to be, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s obvious when health is an issue, you want your loved ones to be around; however, if this is not what they want, it\u2019s no longer a problem for me. When I stopped preaching to my mother, our relationship got much better. She is happy with who she is, and if this is what she chooses for her time left on this earth then it is what it is. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Just like anything else, change comes if and only when we are ready and only then will it happen. When my mother passes one day, I will stand over her grave and think back to when I wanted her to change and then I will come back to the memory of her saying that she was happy with her life.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Barriers to change are other obstacles to overcome when we want to change. What is preventing us from changing? I will go back to my mother\u2019s story (last time I promise). Why wouldn\u2019t she want to stop smoking and get healthy so she can live longer and have a better quality of health? I would surmise that she doesn\u2019t want to make the change because, in her mind, it would be more painful to live without cigarettes than it is to live with them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They give her pleasure even if they are ruining her lungs. They are her companion when she is alone. Maybe she looks at the long term and feels the pain instead of making a specific goal of taking quitting one day at a time. It would be much easier to quit if she would think like this. Change is made when it is self-motivated and by positive thinking.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s important to know that change happens gradually. There will be relapse and there may be discomfort. Very few of us are so strong-willed that we won\u2019t ever have a relapse. Like an alcoholic, not drinking is a lifelong change and one that must always be mindful of.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There will always be factors begging for our attention.

Maybe we were born with spiritual pain or we have unresolved issues that we haven\u2019t let go of and we hold them inside not knowing how to let go. Some believe in past lives and that we are born with pain and this pain is punishment from a past life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those who are Christian, they don\u2019t believe this, but believe that we can remove the pain by giving it to God. Give it to something or someone and let it go if you have it. It\u2019s not worth holding on to. Without being mindful, we hold on to pain so tight that it leaves us exhausted.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of the pain is only in our minds and it is a dialogue we have with ourselves. I am not saying things didn\u2019t happen to you in your past. Maybe you can\u2019t even remember or pin point anything. I couldn\u2019t imagine some of the circumstances people have gone through and are still able to live each day.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have had hardships, but I am blessed that my pain is not as deep as other\u2019s pain. All pain needs to be let go of, though. The point here is to give yourself the gift of seeking out help to rid yourself if you are in pain. Start fresh again, even if for only once in your life. Make the choice to be free.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We don\u2019t understand how much we suffer and, conversely, we don\u2019t know what it is like not to suffer. We expose ourselves to our pain by virtue of being in pain in the first place. We are constantly thinking about the pain of the past, the present and the pain we will endure in the future. We don\u2019t know we are in pain most of the time, however, we feel it but don\u2019t recognize it until we have a problem and it affects our behavior. We constantly talk inside our heads continuously doubting everything and this is causing us to suffer. Having to think about yourself all the time creates pain and suffering.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reason we think about ourselves all the time is because we haven\u2019t been okay for a long time. Listen to your pain; it\u2019s telling you something, telling you that you must do something about it. The problem is we feel it but we don\u2019t acknowledge it. Just like a broken leg tells you it\u2019s broken, your spirit also tells you it\u2019s broken too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pain that we carry around could be minimal or it could be monumental. I have heard that what doesn\u2019t kill us, makes us stronger, and that suffering causes greatness. I don\u2019t necessarily believe this as I believe it leaves pain wounds in our soul and, unless we intentionally choose to heal it, we have a problem.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of us think we are healing our pain by getting better at handling it. To solve your inner problems is to quit letting your mind mislead you. I don\u2019t think time heals all wounds either. Time makes them a little easier to take, but we all know if we let ourselves go there, we can bring back the pain like it was day one. How we do this is by holding in that exact memory of when we first arrived at the pain. We can go back there again and again if we let ourselves.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we think no one will love us and we are alone, or we will always be alone or there will never be someone for us, we are dealing with our minds inner dilemma. When we do find someone and the relationship doesn\u2019t solve the issues that we have, we have an inner disturbance. We realize the void is still within us and then we move onto something else, because the pain is always there. But the real problem is we take our baggage wherever we go and we want to give it to someone else to carry, all the while picking up more as we go along.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Freeing ourselves from pain is a matter of unloading the memory and detaching the connection we have to it and then allowing it to diminish. It will take time and it will take a conscious effort to do it, but it can be done. If you have lost a loved one, you will have pain. In time it will get better. You will always have the good memories.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have to address the source of our pain and not just cover it up or hide behind it. What if you did find a person or something that got rid of your pain? Have you really succeeded in solving the problem?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nope, you just failed because you found something to delay or distract you, maybe a relationship in this case, in which you believe the other person will fix all your problems, or you\u2019ll be okay as long as they are with you. Heck, you no longer believe you have any problems. You will see that you are still tormented as long as your inner stuff is not resolved.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The only way to resolve this inner conflict is to get out of it. Get out of your head and get out of your way. Let it go and remind yourself to listen to the addiction that your mind has created by staying in this place.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stop and don\u2019t get involved in your mind\u2019s inner thoughts. Your mind is only playing games with you and you are going along with it. Be persistent in staying focused on not letting your mind tell you how bad things are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You must stop it the second it starts talking. Don\u2019t let a little reminder make a shift in your body telling your mind that you are about to go to the inner nagging again. Stop it before it starts. Be aware and don\u2019t let your mind talk; only allow your mind to talk when you ask it a question and only ask when necessary.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The price of freedom from the pain is peace; therefore, we have to change. Change means we have to challenge what we know and what we are comfortable with. The key here is comfort. We are too comfortable with our disturbances, and thinking about change feels even more painful than staying where we are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After all, we know the feeling and we are comfortable, even if it hurts. But, how do you know that change will be painful? What if it is a much better life and you don\u2019t take the steps to get there because you are too afraid? How will you ever know about the life you could have if you don\u2019t step over the line and try it? There are no boundaries that we must live in, just the ones we create.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Real growth means dealing with the discomfort, like it or not. Many times the actions we take are to avoid something. Stop avoiding and don\u2019t let issues upset you. If you are avoiding pain and you encounter what you can\u2019t avoid, then walk along side of it until it passes. And, if you do nothing else, don\u2019t take things personally. Much of what goes on around you has absolutely nothing to do with you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take care of yourself :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">grief<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to move on<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">LETTING GO OF EMOTIONAL PAIN<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">suffering<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/28167318_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":457,"slug":"what-are-you-meant-to-do","type":"post","title":"What are you meant to do?","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What are you meant to do?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What are you meant to do? What gifts do you possess that you have not yet discovered within yourself? That\u2019s a rhetorical question because, if you knew what gift or gifts you had, then it would already be discovered, right? Well, not really.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You could be fantastic at many different things and you may not even realize it. These are the gifts that others see within you or that you are really good at. I cook a lot and I cook for a lot of people.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a matter of fact, those who I cook for tell me I should open a restaurant, be a chef or a caterer. I was told this for many years, but I wasn\u2019t hearing it. I just took their words with a grain of salt and thought they were only compliments I was being given as a token for making them food.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, even though I was good at it, I believed it was just my hobby, and sometimes when you try and turn your hobby into a job, you don\u2019t enjoy it anymore. I didn\u2019t want a job; I wanted to continue having a hobby to relax and enjoy myself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes we are born with certain talents. Well, not sometimes. I believe we all have at least one or two or even three, maybe more. Cooking is my natural gift, but writing is what I love to do. So there are two things I have to work with.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surely either one of these will make me happy if I pursue them. What is your natural gift? If you don\u2019t know, think about what others always tell you that you are good at. If you are passionate about something but feel you can\u2019t do it for a living, then do it part-time. You must do what your soul calls you to do, otherwise, you are only working to pay bills and then die. On the other hand, if you like what you do and it\u2019s paying your bills, then maybe this is what you are supposed to be doing and this conversation is moot.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are more people working in fields that they don\u2019t hold a degree in and, usually, it\u2019s not by choice. We usually have to go where the money pays the bills and, before long, we are stuck in a job we don\u2019t like or one that doesn\u2019t challenge us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don\u2019t know one person in my life who absolutely loves what they do for a living. They are okay with what they do, but they don\u2019t love it. Maybe not all of us are lucky enough to love what we do, however, it\u2019s worth it to try to do the work that we have a passion for.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you honestly taken the time to find out what you are made of, or do you know you should find out but continue to put it off? As the saying goes, \u201cSomeday I will get to it\u201d, as in cleaning your closet or organizing your drawers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me light a fire underneath you and remind you that <em>someday<\/em> will never come. What will come instead is \u201ca road to nowhere.\u201d Someday is when you wake up and you are literally too old to do what you should have done, only now you mourn the loss of what you can\u2019t do anymore.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, I know, we are never too old to live our dream, but yes you are. If you want to live in Alaska for a year and live off the land, it gets pretty cold when you are in your late stages of life to do that. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I hear, \u201cIf I were twenty years younger, I would . . .\u201d I want to say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do it when you were twenty years younger?\u201d I make it sound so easy, don\u2019t I? Well, it is. If you take anything away from this, do now what you might put off later because we both know you probably won\u2019t do it. Life gets in the way and then life flies by, and pretty soon we no longer have the opportunities we once had.\u00a0What are you meant to do?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I hope you are lucky enough to find your passion :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">finding your purpose<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">what am I here for?finding what you're good at<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">What are you meant to do?<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">What is your natural gift? passion<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">what should I do for a living<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/41044534_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":453,"slug":"food-allergy-or-food-sensitivity","type":"post","title":"Food Allergy or Food Sensitivity?","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Food Allergy or Food Sensitivity?<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The lab results are back and you are allergic to everything you're eating!\" This is what my doctor told me at a follow up visit.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course I was confused. \u00a0How could I be allergic to everything that I ate? \u00a0Wouldn't I be dead? \u00a0She handed me a report sort of like the book reports that we used to turn in, in high school. \u00a0You know the ones that have title, introduction, body and a conclusion. \u00a0All nicely three hold punched between a clear front and back cover.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I could see the title through the clear cover and it said. \u00a0\"Food Allergy report for Theresa Skrobanek.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was about ten pages long. \u00a0My doctor said that my allergies were more like a food sensitivity because I was eating the exact same things each day and\/or, I had some other allergies so, I needed to eliminate all the foods in the report and then slowly work them back into my diet to see which ones I was allergic to and, which ones I had a food sensitivity to.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was beside myself because that seemed like way too much effort and being a person who loves to eat, I was freaked out. \u00a0More so because, I'm already a Vegetarian and I was limited as it was to what I ate and now, I had to eliminate the rest of what I ate!!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Turns out that the problem was the frequency of what I ate. \u00a0On a typical day for about fifteen plus years, I would wake up, get a handful of almonds and shower. \u00a0Then, I would head out the door to work and at lunch I would head to Whole Foods and get tofu and salad.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For dinner, I would eat carbs, etc. and some kind of protein. \u00a0But I did this everyday of the week and soon it became a problem. \u00a0I didn't know it but my body was no longer absorbing any nutrients from the food \u00a0I was eating. It was now sensitive to what I ate.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We've all heard that too much of a good thing is not a good thing and who would have thought that those tasty little almonds would become my enemy all when I thought they were keeping me so healthy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people do get sick from food allergies, etc. but, I just gained weight and lost nutrients. \u00a0My bones became brittle, I was anemic, my doctor added one supplement after another marking it up as just getting older until she decided to check me for food allergies. \u00a0It was as though I wasn't eating at all but just getting the calories stored on my body.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are a lot of food allergies like gluten, dairy, yeast, sugar, wheat, corn, food additives, fermented products and even (dare I say it!) wine. \u00a0I love wine.. \u00a0I won't make this a longer blog post than it needs to be because if you suspect you have a problem, it's wise to get a blood test. \u00a0It's quick and simple. \u00a0Just don't get carried away and walk around like I did and act like your allergic to everything a now you can't eat.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I eliminated the foods on the report and then worked them back into my diet. \u00a0Turns out that the change I needed was to not eat the same thing everyday and diversify my diet by, at least rotating food groups, like we all should do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I do stay away from gluten and I have found out if you have an auto immune problem, like thyroid disorders (like I do), gluten can be like allergy and may attack the thyroid. \u00a0I don't want to take more medicine so it's very easy to avoid gluten.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who knows, maybe I created the auto immune problem in the first place by eating the same exact thing everyday?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the end, I am no longer anemic, my bones are stronger, I have lost ten pounds and I try to never eat the same foods two days in a row. \u00a0I haven't gone back to get retested. \u00a0I guess for now, I will listen to my body..<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">food allergies<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">Food Allergy or Food Sensitivity?<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">food sensitivity<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">gluten<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">lose weight<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">throid problems<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/44170745_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":446,"slug":"resisting-what-must-be-done","type":"post","title":"RESISTING WHAT MUST BE DONE","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">RESISTING WHAT MUST BE DONE<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I may need Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), but I won\u2019t go. You may need to lose weight, but it\u2019s too hard. My son may need to study harder to get good grades, but he won\u2019t.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all have things we should do, and maybe we really need to do them, but we won\u2019t. We resist. Why do we resist? Because we think doing them will be painful.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My daughter told me that I hurt her feelings the other night, but I don\u2019t remember. Now, it is very painful and breaks my heart to think that I have caused someone I love pain. But what will I do about it? Will I take a deep look at myself and ask the question, \u201cDo I drink too much wine?\u201d Or will I shove it under the rug blaming her as being too sensitive.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all find ways to justify the things we do. It\u2019s hard to step back and see ourselves the way others do. I\u2019m not saying they are right, but if enough people are saying the same thing, then we should listen.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all do things to defend the way we live. Let\u2019s face it, if change were easy we would all change often. We make changing harder than it needs to be. Although, it can be difficult, because we can take one step forward and two steps back leaving us discouraged and then we give up.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you take a few steps back, it\u2019s not the end of the world. Change takes time and it\u2019s not a straightforward event. Most of us don\u2019t wake up and see that we need to make a life change, and then, on the first attempt, make the change without having any setbacks.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think of those who have quit smoking. Yes, some quit cold turkey but most try several times before they finally quit. Those who attend AA have a sponsor to help them stay the course and, many times, for a lifetime. The truth is, those of us who falter don\u2019t fall all the way down. When we try to change, we create stepping-stones that prepare us for the next step.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do what must be done. Change starts with contemplation, preparation and action. You may be stuck in the contemplation mode for a very long time. This is the time when we are aware that we need to change and we comprehend that a change must be made in order to have a better life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is when we know there is a problem. Maybe your awareness is because of others pushing you toward a change. This time is also when we weigh whether or not the change is worth it. Some of us stay in the contemplation stage forever. We stay on the fence and don\u2019t take the opportunity to better our lives.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We know we need to, but we are stuck in either fear or indecision. For some, it takes days or weeks to make a move and, for others, it is too painful to continue on their current path. The important thing is we are open to change as opposed to the reverse.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next stage is the preparation phase. This is when we begin to plan for how we will make the change. We do the research and then take the first step. Someone who needs to lose weight may join a gym. Someone who needs to stop drinking may go to their first meeting. It\u2019s also the time where outside forces begin to tug trying to pull us back into old habits. In order to be successful in making a change we must create strategies to maintain a different behavior. Temptation to go back to our old ways will be all around us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The final (well nothing is final except death, right?) step will be to maintain your results. At this stage we create a time goal, for example, three months, six months, one year and so on. I know many people who quit smoking and were told the cravings would decrease after thirty days and the habit of wanting a cigarette in their hand would cease after ninety. T<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">hey were told that if they could get past these milestones, they were practically home free. Ex-smokers never forget their one-year mark from when they finally quit. Many still count the years since they had quit.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the maintenance stage you should be out of the pain state and enjoying the new and improved you. The focus at this point is preventing yourself from ever returning to your old ways. Hopefully, at this stage you are stronger and more confident to maintain and sustain the new you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is there something that you need to do in order to be a better you? If something within your spirit is telling you that something is not right, trust your intuition because it\u2019s probably right. It\u2019s not talking to you for nothing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your inner self senses something is wrong way before you acknowledge it. I call this God speaking to you. I am not a religious person, but I am spiritual. We would all be a lot better off if we listen to our God-given gift of intuition. The same intuition that tells us not to go down that dark alley, and the same one that told us something we didn\u2019t listen to it and we suffered the consequences.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes when this happens to me I ask God why he let this happen and I always get an inner voice that answers me, \u201cI tried to warn you, but you wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d Have you ever had this kind of experience? Listen to your inner self and it will always guide you in the right direction.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a difference between fear and intuition, and when you learn to trust your inner voice you will learn the difference.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">a better you<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">god<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">intuition<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">quit smoking<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">RESISTING WHAT MUST BE DONE<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">stages of change<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">stop resisting yourself<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">time for a change<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/33590663_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":440,"slug":"fear-is-a-liar","type":"post","title":"Fear Is A Liar!","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Fear Is A Liar!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wake up and feel the fear. Yep, exposure is how we get over fear, not by hiding from it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We resist life because we have an underlying fear of not. Overcoming fear is a deliberate intention of taking action to take the necessary steps to do so.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to overcome fear, you must give up the struggle to remain afraid. We try too hard to protect ourselves and, thus, we don\u2019t grow and we remain troubled.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you heard the phrase \u201cYou create what you fear\u201d? It\u2019s true. What you put out there comes back to you. If you fear you will always be broke, you will always be broke. If you fear you will always be alone, you will display this to others and you may even push others away.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other side of this is to never make a decision based on fear because the opposite of what you intend will happen.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people build their whole life avoiding fear. They set their lives up so they don\u2019t encounter anything that is troubling. We are not talking about the boogieman or a fear of spiders here, we are talking about the internal fear and the pain we hide inside.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It could be rejection or insecurity, whatever the pain is. We have to ask ourselves why we have fear and pain. By avoiding pain we end up bringing pain into every part of our life. Events affect our heart and simple things cause us pain, insecurity and an unfulfilled life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s time to get some perspective and not let meaningless things control our lives. For me, I had the pain of social anxiety. It was very painful for me to go out in large social events. I didn\u2019t realize this and I carried this pain for a long time. And what\u2019s worse is that I manipulated the world around me to avoid the pain.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to be comfortable without anxiety, but I felt others were judging me when I was only judging myself. To be free, I began to realize that I was afraid of rejection. Wow! How ridiculous is that? First of all, people weren\u2019t concerned about me at all. I only imagined they were.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most people only care about themselves and they are not focusing on anything more than that. But what part of rejection was I really afraid of? Was I not good enough, pretty enough, smart enough? No one is perfect, right?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eventually, I got over this by changing my thinking. I realized I didn\u2019t feel good enough. This comes from childhood and issues about being moved from place to place and never being able to connect to long-term relationships.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is the kicker: we don\u2019t have to be afraid. We can teach ourselves to unlearn most emotional pain and habits that keep us there. Nothing, or no one, came into my life and caused my anxiety; it was just my way of thinking that caused my pain. Nothing outside of me caused it and nothing outside of me could fix it. I was both the cause and the answer to my problem.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If for any reason you are living with some type of fear that is preventing you from living a full life, you can overcome it. Get some help, read self-help books, join groups, talk to someone. Make it your mission to remove this barrier while you still have time to create the life you deserve.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">anxiety<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">fear<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">Fear Is A Liar!<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to overcome fear<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to overcome social anxiety and anxiety<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">living in fear<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">social anxiety<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/29575892_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":428,"slug":"428","type":"post","title":"","content":"ARE YOU ORDINARY NOT EXTRAORDINARY?\n\nAre you an ordinary person who goes about your day doing plain and ordinary things when really inside you are extraordinary?\n\nAre you a person hiding behind the effort to be the best you can be? Do you have this feeling, this innate knowing that you have a gift, a talent, an ability to be more than you are right now?\n\nHave you always known there was something special about you, or that you could do something different or better than anyone else, but you don\u2019t try?\n\nWe do mediocre work and we put in very little effort even when we know we are more capable and can do better. Maybe you are a genius, but you are fearful of exploiting it, or you can\u2019t find the right opportunity to do so.\n\nI know super smart people who don\u2019t do anything more than what they have to do each day. They just exist. I wish I had one tenth of the intelligence I see go to waste.\n\nMaybe you are a really good singer but you are afraid to get up and sing. You dream in your head about how awesome it would be to sing like no one was watching, and you fantasize about trying out for American Idol or something similar, even something smaller, but you just can\u2019t do it.\n\nSure you could have stage freight and chalk it up to that, therefore, you feel better by justifying that it\u2019s normal, so you will never live your dream. Instead of dreaming what you could be, take the steps to overcome the fear so you can be. I would bet that most singers had to overcome stage fright, too.\n\nThere are rarely any naturals out there as most have to practice doing what they love to do. I have a fear of speaking in front of a group. Many do, but I imagine that mine is extreme, but it\u2019s not. If you search on Google for this, it is the number one fear, even more so than dying.\n\nI can\u2019t say I would rather die than speak because if God gave me only one choice, my fear would go right out the window to save my life. However, I don\u2019t need to speak to groups because it\u2019s not something I long to do, and not just because of the fear. I have no interest in speaking.\n\nAlthough this could change as life does, this is something that will never be in my way. However, if you have a passion along with some talent and the only way to get you to your dream is having to expose yourself to your fear, then you better do it rather than live a life half full.\n\nThey say before you die you don\u2019t regret what you did, but what you didn\u2019t do. I love to write, not because I think I am a good writer, but because if I laid on my death bed and didn\u2019t write than I would feel a sense of loss and disappointment.\n\nHave you ever profoundly regretted something? Maybe you should have said sorry, but you didn\u2019t and now it\u2019s too late, or you left a great relationship only to find the grass wasn\u2019t greener and now you live with regret?\n\nIf I listen to fear tell me I suck at writing (which it often does) and I don\u2019t write, I am defeated and then I become ordinary, not extraordinary. Maybe I am not a great writer like Ernest Hemingway, but I am being extraordinary for trying because not many people write everyday.\n\nWhat is it that you need to begin and then finish? Only ordinary people don\u2019t reach beyond what they are capable of doing. Being extraordinary doesn\u2019t equate to being what society might view as successful but, instead, it means what\u2019s successful in your eyes.\n\nI may feel extraordinary to myself and not to others, but isn\u2019t that all that really matters anyway? In the end, aren\u2019t we only in a race with ourselves?

So in essence one might take a dose of Melatonin before going under any radiation treatment or X-rays.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides the benefits of helping us sleep as a supplement for insomnia, some are asking if Melatonin is a medical marvel or a medical myth?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course we need a lot more research for the use of Melatonin however, I would say that I take it every night for sleep and it lives up to my expectations. \u00a0If I get a recharged immune system as a side effect well, that's even better!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Did you know that Melatonin is a hormone? \u00a0Yep! I was surprised to learn that and then worried that I was taking a hormone and we all know what some hormones can do and that is to possibly raise our cancer risk. \u00a0However, studies have found that Melatonin is absolutely safe.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have a serious illness such as leukemia, lymphoma, an autoimmune disorder or major depression it will be wise for you to consult your doctor before taking Melatonin. \u00a0If you're pregnant don't take it either.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Melatonin provides anti-aging effects without poisoning any of our body's organs. \u00a0It actually fosters internal harmony. \u00a0There is no toxic risk, no dependency, or adverse effects.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'll keep you updated on what else I find out about it. \u00a0Until then, you should probably consider Melatonin.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">anti-aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">can't sleep<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">cancer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to get to sleep<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">immune system<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">Melatonin can stimulate your immune system<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">supplements<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">white blood cells<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/31804240_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":417,"slug":"good-intentions","type":"post","title":"GOOD INTENTIONS","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">GOOD INTENTIONS<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of us have good intentions, but we let resistance get in the way. Good intentions mean that we want to do the stuff that needs to be done, but we also don\u2019t want to disappoint others.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Often times, we will disappoint ourselves before we will others. Sometimes we intend to do what we need to do to get ahead in life, but our intentions are half-done because we may procrastinate or be unorganized.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We may set ourselves up for failure by creating lofty dreams that are beyond our reach. Some may say, \"No dream is beyond our reach. We must reach for the sky and make it happen. We can become anything we dream of if we just do the work.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This may be true; however, if you want to be a singer so badly, but your voice is not good, then no matter how hard you try you most likely will not be a singer. Same goes for being a professional basketball player, football player, etc. First you have to have the foundation for what you want to become.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, there are exceptions, but they are not usual and, of course, we can practice ten thousand hours, but if we can\u2019t sing, jump or run, we are probably wasting our time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can still live in the music world by writing music, playing an instrument, teaching music or many others ways. Same is true with sports or anything else we have a passion for. Just because we can\u2019t be the one thing we imagined doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t modify our journey to get there.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The important thing is to see this and to acknowledge it and not to live in denial, because that only wastes time. Many of us fight tooth and nail and never make it to our goals, even with good intentions. Again, don\u2019t waste time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be persistent in finding what it is that you excel at. Try several things and then narrow it down. In sales they used to say that you could not make a salesman, you are either born one or not. I think we can train people to become salespeople and I also agree that certain people are natural salespeople. They just have that ability and charm to sell anyone anything.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn\u2019t mean the person who was trained can\u2019t make a good living in sales, it just means the person who has the innate ability may do better. In your life, do you want to work as a trained person trying to fit into a mold, or do you want to do something that you are naturally good at? Doing what you love is the reward this life can give you. Are you brave enough to find out what that is?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other side of this is we may realize that we are not suitable for something, but continue to pursue it anyway. Or, something beyond our control gets in the way and our dream is no longer possible. Even with good intentions events beyond our control will happen.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This happened to a friend of mine. Her son always dreamed of being a pilot. He didn\u2019t want to go into the military until he received his bachelor\u2019s degree so he could go in with a higher rank. Life got in the way of his plans and, into his second year of college, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When you have bipolar disorder and take medication, you can\u2019t be a pilot and, unfortunately, bipolar disorder can be a lifetime diagnosis. So then what do you do?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though my friend\u2019s son had intended to become a pilot, life got in the way and his plans were changed whether he liked it or not. That\u2019s how it goes sometimes. Sometimes we are ahead and sometimes we are behind. The important thing is that which brings us down can also raise us up.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He had to reconcile himself to stop imagining flying a jet. The vision he had for many years was gone without ever being tried, and I understand this is unfortunate and probably hard to take. He had to see a new dream and he didn\u2019t like this new vision at all. For a long time, he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge that he could no longer become a pilot and said the doctors diagnosed him wrong, even going so far as stopping his medicine.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bipolar symptoms would reappear and, eventually, he had to come to terms with taking the medication and not being a pilot. As sad as it is, life hits us like this and it\u2019s just the way it is. The key is to be flexible in life. It\u2019s the only way we can get through the times when life is beyond our control.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we are rigid and we don\u2019t want to accept certain circumstances, they will still happen whether we like them or not, and we will become stuck and left behind. The funny thing about life is no matter what happens in it, good or bad, it keeps moving even if we don\u2019t.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because my friend\u2019s son couldn\u2019t be a pilot doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have another calling. I won\u2019t go into the \u201cif one door is closed another one is opened\u201d philosophy because this blog post is not a philosophy or psychology book and, really, that\u2019s probably a little too cheesy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I understand that some would probably be a little pissed off at themselves, the doctors, God, their DNA or whatever the reason because all they wanted was to have a dream, as they tell us to do, and pursue it, as they tell us to do, and become who we are meant to be, as they tell us to, and now fate steps in and screws it all up.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s hard not to blame something or someone for what life doesn\u2019t give us. At this point, you have no other choice but to move on to the next person you were meant to be. Pitying yourself or not being anything that is good is not one of your choices either. Who knows, maybe the next person was who you were always supposed to be in the first place and divine intervention stepped in?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When life doesn\u2019t work out the way we had planned, we must still have good intentions. The key is to move forward. Because you have to leave one dream behind doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still create another one. You have to ask yourself the question again, \u201cWho am I now and who do I want to be?\u201d As we create a new dream, we may experience pain, anguish or sorrow for what we have lost, but we don\u2019t need to suffer because we will always have choices.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may not see where you need to go sometimes. Everyone goes through light and dark times and it\u2019s a part of life. If we resist going through these times then this is when we begin to think like we are fighting a losing battle.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s only life getting the best of us in our minds. We will lose those we love, we will get sick, we will have things happen that are just ridiculously unfair. It happens to everyone and no one will escape the process as long as they are alive.

You know that paper that\u2019s important now, but wasn\u2019t when you placed it on the counter, and now you can\u2019t find it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That paper that, if you don\u2019t find soon, you are screwed. The one you blame everyone else for moving to another place or throwing away. In your mind you laid it \u201cright there\u201d and now it is gone. Maybe it\u2019s your Jury duty summons and you forgot what day it was, only to realize it was today or approaching very soon.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now you are in trouble. Maybe it\u2019s your instructions, passport, a renewal form, a policy, homework, a check, your wallet, whatever. Every day some of us choose to misplace something or we can\u2019t find what we are looking for and we waste precious time searching for it. Unlike anything else in life, we will never get back lost time and it seems like such a waste of life to be always looking for what you have lost.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The only way to overcome this is to get organized.\u00a0Not being unorganized is another form of resistance and procrastination. Yes, another habit one chooses to do. This post is not about ways that I can get you organized, because it\u2019s not really about a plan at this point.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure I can help you organize your drawers by giving you ways to label everything, or I can help you organize your closet by giving you examples of ways to organize your closet, but, again, it\u2019s not really about that. Even if I did, would you do it? Being unorganized in life is a lot different and here is why.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having a life that is organized has it benefits. Being organized saves us time, stress and money. If you live a stressful life because you can never find anything, than you probably know how it feels to be organized at least once in your life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s a great feeling to look around and see everything in its place and to know what is in place. To have the ability at a moment\u2019s notice to request something from yourself and then go straight to it is a great experience.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have searched with others for hours looking for something, a wallet for example, only to chalk it up as being lost. Afterwards, the person who lost it went and cancelled their credit cards, got a new license and bought a new wallet. We found this wallet stashed in dirty clothes about three weeks later. What a waste of precious time and money to go through all that and, you know, it will more than likely be lost again until this person sets her mind to being organized.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why should you be organized? Because for one thing, not being so can have health consequences such as being stressed, and we all know that stress causes high blood pressure, heart attacks and tons of other stuff I could name, but I know you get the point.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being unorganized not only affects your health in a detrimental way, it also affects your productivity so much that you may be working at a low paying job or losing money because of it. By being organized you are efficient, which means that you are reliable, valuable and indispensable. If you are this way, it is likely that you will make more money, you will get promoted and you might never get fired.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you feel that you are not always organized, but organized enough because maybe you show up at your job on time and in uniform, just so you know, it takes way more than that. By being haphazardly organized, you are not getting the true benefit of your job, meaning others see what you don\u2019t think they do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will also realize they do because you rarely get a raise and you probably don\u2019t get promoted. Many who are not organized are glad they have a job, but wonder why they are not further along in life. Maybe you think that your organization skills have nothing to do with your job because you work at a dead-end job and making extra effort won\u2019t get you anywhere or any more money.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But an organized person gathers the information to create options to do better rather than staying in a dead-end job. They take the initiative and the necessary steps according to how they set up their own system to move ahead. An unorganized person has no system at all. Better yet, they say they will get to it later or they will start looking soon. Before they know it, years and people have passed them by, while they blame everyone else for where they are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To break the cycle, determine why you are unorganized and then begin to unclutter your life. If you honestly don\u2019t have time for anything, then it\u2019s time to make time and start eliminating some of the events in your life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you work two jobs, work one better. If you run all over the place dropping off kids after work, try partnering with others to help or eliminate events. Decide to change. Determine what area of your life needs to change. Often times all we need to do is make a small change and everything else falls into place.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using a calendar helps tremendously. We have smart phones now and they all have calendars that can remind us of when and where we need to be. Try to fill in the calendar for as far out as you can: days, weeks, even months. Every time a new event or appointment occurs, be diligent in putting it in your calendar. Anything that you need to do that can\u2019t be put on the calendar, create the list I referred to before. Again, smart phones have lists apps too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t avoid doing any of these things the moment they need to be done and when that calendar reminds you, do what you need to. Work on your list until you complete it, and then once you get in the habit, you will create a mental list and the list becomes minimal. No more long lists because you are staying on top of your game. Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by doing too much in the beginning. This is the only time you should spread out all the things you need to initially get done. Delegate the tasks that you don\u2019t want to do to others and, most important, don\u2019t always be a yes person and agree to things you know you won\u2019t be able to do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do the best you can. On any given day, your best will change. One day you will be tired so your best may be the best for that day. On another day you will have an abundance of energy, use this time wisely. Just do your best and you will never have to second guess yourself or fall back to your old ways.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">Being unorganized effects your health<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">hart attacks<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be organized<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">memory loss<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">procrastination<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/38046991_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":407,"slug":"eat-right-or-die-young","type":"post","title":"Eat right or die young!","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eat right or die young!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fats in our diets are usually the least likely to help our heath. \u00a0In fact, most are carcinogenic! Yep! Cancer helpers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So if you don't want to invite cancer into your life then start by eliminating these types of bad foods!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Burnt foods, BBQ'd, smoked, fried<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">High fat cheese, butter, salad dressing and high fat oils<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead, eat whole grains, legumes, fresh organic veggies, and fresh low glycemic fruits.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me tell why you should avoid the above mention bad foods.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">*The best and smartest thing we can do is to avoid high fat intake. \u00a0This in itself will help fight cancer and keep us healthy and looking young.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Frying foods creates as toxic mix. \u00a0In addition to cooking your meal, by frying your foods, you are cooking up a toxic cascade of carcinogens. It's very wise to eliminate all fried foods.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meat is another food you might want to avoid because meats are high in fat. \u00a0In fact, women who eat meat daily have four times the breast cancer rate of women who eat meat less than once or so per week.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know, if you love meat this is a hard one to do however, maybe you can eliminate it once or twice a week.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dairy foods are made from animals and they are loaded with fat, pesticides, hormones and other toxins. \u00a0Don't get fooled by butter substitutes either because they have large amounts of ugly fats called trans-fats.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you like eggs, try and have one egg yolk per two egg whites. \u00a0The yolks have a lot of cholesterol.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use oils sparingly. \u00a0Some are better than others like olive oil, etc. but they pack a lot of calories and more fat than you need.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Salad dressings are the foods that we don't realize that we eat way too much of. \u00a0Standard and even the lite versions are usually high in fat.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Make your own dressing by using balsamic vinegar, lemons\/limes, herbs, etc. \u00a0Make it ahead and put it in a glass container to have a hand so you won't reach for the fat dressings. \u00a0Add soy yogurt to make it creamy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though there are what is called \"good fats\" like in avocados and peanut butter etc. remember that a tablespoon of peanut butter is usually about 100 calories, which 90 calories of that is fat. \u00a0You should only have 10% fat in your diet so with two tablespoons of peanut butter, you've had your fat for the day. \u00a0Eat your fat wisely so you can enjoy it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: If you eat peanut butter make sure its organic and certified Alfatoxin free as Alflatoxin is a mold-borne carcinogen common in peanuts. \u00a0Make sure you drain the oil after opening.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly I will talk about snacks. \u00a0Just try and eat God made and not man made :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here's to your health, aging well and living for a very long time.

Use your fork!","content":"You want to fight cancer? Use your fork!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's no surprise that anti-aging and diet are inter-dependent. \u00a0Some foods promote cancer while others prevent it. \u00a0By eating the right foods and taking the right supplements we can dramatically reduce our overall risk of cancer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are thousands of molecules in foods. \u00a0Certain ones help us fight cancer. \u00a0These are essential nutrients and phyto-chemicals. These are anti-cancer compounds that interrupt the cancer formation process.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, foods\/supplements with vitamin C stop nitrates from becoming carcinogenic. \u00a0Then there are the blocking agents of minerals that activate enzymes that chew up and remove cancer causers by breaking them up into little harmless waste products.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are suppressing agents that block the progression of cancer once its begun. \u00a0These agents can be found it beta-carotene, selenium, calcium, flavonoids, plants. and DHEA.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Certain nutrients may have the ability to block metastasis promotion, detoxify carcinogenic molecules, encourage DNA repair, inhibit tumor growth factors, interfere with the binding of cancer cells, nourish the immune system, strengthen our natural barriers to carcinogens and much more.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You've heard the quote by\u00a0<b>Hippocrates<\/b>\u00a0\"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\" It's true. \u00a0If you want to live disease free or at least much healthier while you are on this planet, eat like your life depends on it! \u00a0You won't believe how good you will feel.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have been a vegetarian for about 22 years. \u00a0I started eating cheese and dairy about five years ago. \u00a0In the last year or so, I have felt arthritis in my fingers and it got so painful that I was having trouble putting my shoes on. \u00a0I actually yelled out in pain last week. \u00a0That's when I knew something wasn't right.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When your body is telling you something, its manifesting itself from inflammation\/disease and the result is pain and symptoms.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After doing research, I found that dairy is very acidic and acid causes inflammation in the body. \u00a0What also causes arthritis? Inflammation. \u00a0So naturally, if I ad more acid it will cause more inflammation and the cycle get's worse.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have three choices at this point. \u00a0I live with the pain (because I hate medicine), I get a prescription or, I do what is the natural thing to do and that is, to listen to my body and get off of dairy. No brainer!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Too many times we get symptoms and rather than find out what the source of the problem is, we cover it up by thinking it's just old age or genetics or whatever we are doomed to have.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But really, is it that or instead our inability to make necessary changes to our diet. For example most type 2 diabetes can be reversed by eating better and exercising. \u00a0We can avoid certain cancer just by elimination with things like carcinogens. \u00a0We could also improve the chances of keeping cancer at bay if we ate 90% plant based diets.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I stopped the dairy and it's been about a week and I swear, I feel 90% less joint pain. \u00a0I've went back and forth testing my theory about dairy and each time I come back to being pain free. \u00a0I'm at the point to where even my great love of cheese pizza or cheese and wine doesn't sound better than being pain free.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like they say, we will do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure, I'm just glad I finally made that switch.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The take away here is two things. \u00a0One, do you have pain, \u00a0chronic disease or, an illness that you can try to \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food?\" and two, if you don't could you start to eat like you might avoid them in the first place?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">acid<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">arthritis<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">cancer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">CFS<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">diabetes<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">diet<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">healthy eating<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">Hippocrates Hippocrates Quotes.

He looked at me, but said nothing and continued to postpone even the thought of it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My son is a young man who makes his life a lot more difficult than it has to be by procrastinating. No matter what it is in his life, a speeding ticket, homework, an appointment, whatever, he will wait until the very last minute to do what he needs to do to get where he needs to be.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He does no research, no prep work and wonders why his life is always chasing him. His life is always in chaos as he lives through the consequences of procrastinating, both internal, by feeling and being anxious, and external, by having to turn in sub-par homework, forgetting about the speeding ticket and having to spend twice as much time showing up for court. And, let\u2019s not forget the financial circumstances that come along with procrastinating.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The worse thing is he doesn\u2019t see it. He doesn\u2019t believe he procrastinates, but blames everyone and everything around him. I see it, others see it, but he does not, and no matter how much I gently try to show him his ways and explain that his life can be much easier, he only sees and believes what he wants to.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s disheartening, especially for a mother, to watch someone we care about go through pain and know there is nothing we can do about it, even when we know there is a solution. Like anything else though, he will have to experience the pain before he can see the light. I just hope it doesn\u2019t take a lifetime.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The one thing he does have is a beautiful spirit, and I hope he doesn\u2019t take too long so that his beauty can shine through. If he takes too long procrastinating, he will always be distracted and others will never be able to see the real man inside. I have seen, too many times, those who needlessly suffer by their own doing when a shift in thinking is all they need.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think of all the money and time it costs us when we procrastinate. I have already stated what my son does, and he lives at home. I wonder how he will be able to survive on his own. If he doesn\u2019t decide to change his habit of postponing and delaying his life, he may endure a life of financial disaster, among other things.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is not unusual for a procrastinator to delay paying their bills and incurring late charges. It is not likely he will save money because he will probably justify in his mind that \u201che will do it later.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many more examples of what one can do to create a damaging financial future, because we may be a financial procrastinator and we have definite mental hurdles to overcome. We may postpone our taxes, even if we\u2019re due a refund. We may lose discounts because we didn\u2019t pay on time. When you think about it, just the financial part alone is enough to make one stop being reactive and start being proactive.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Procrastination has its emotional effects, too. We can feel so overwhelmed and over-burdened by waiting until the last minute that we do nothing at all. Even depression is linked to being a procrastinator.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you feel you are hopeless, you are not. No one is beyond the ability to stop. It doesn\u2019t mean that you were born lazy, unless you want to be, or that you can\u2019t be an efficient person. Procrastination is just a habit. Hear me here: it\u2019s JUST A HABIT and nothing more. It is up to you to make the choice to change.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are not born with a condition called \u201cprocrastination,\u201d we merely create a habit. We choose to procrastinate because that\u2019s what we do and we get used to it. There are no drugs that will keep us from doing it; it\u2019s just us who must become aware of what we are doing and break the habit.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We don\u2019t need to make more of procrastination than what it is and, again, it is only a habit that we choose. We can all overcome procrastination. How do we do this? We look for the reason why we procrastinate in the first place so we can create a strategy to turn our life around. It\u2019s as simple as viewing the things we need to do as painful, rather than enjoyment.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00ad\u00ad\u00adEveryday, people quit all kinds of habits, like nail biting, smoking cigarettes, over eating and so many more. You may say these actions are addictions, and I would agree, but they all started with an initial habit.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The good news is procrastinating is not an addiction. I am not a doctor, but I would bet that you don\u2019t need therapy for it unless you are also clinically depressed, and that may mean you procrastinate because you have lost the drive to do more than what is necessary. Even so, this can be treated too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just so you know, there is no quick fix for procrastination. Like any other habit, we will not wake up one morning and say, \u201cToday I will never procrastinate again.\u201d Because, even though we may say it and we may sincerely mean it, we are creatures of habit and we usually go back to who we are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is true that very few people change (remember the resistant thinking I wrote about in an earlier post?), however, people can and do change if and when they really want to.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>If they really want to<\/em> are the key words here. Just like anything we need to do, we have to want to do it and, until then, like my son, nothing will ever change on its own. Life will keep moving, but your life will never transform until you do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to get things done<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">life lessons<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">not living a full life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">procrastination<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">progress<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">resisting<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/30625980_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":383,"slug":"a-way-to-lose-easily-lose-a-few-pounds","type":"post","title":"A way to easily lose a few pounds!","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A way to easily lose a few pounds!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A way to easily lose a few pounds. I gained ten pounds, two pounds at a time so I really didn\u2019t notice it until I started feeling miserable.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, ten pounds isn\u2019t really that much however, if we gain that much each decade, which doctors say it\u2019s a very high percentage of that do as we grow older, than eventually, it\u2019s going to catch up to us and manifest itself through obesity, a shift in our bodies ability to maintain the shape that we once had and, through diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease etc.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few modifications are all that is needed to get slimmer and stay that way.\u00a0 It takes 3500 calories to add a pound to our body.\u00a0 As we get older we tend to eat a little more fat and carbohydrates than we used to.\u00a0 With that we add way more calories without even noticing that we added one-hundred, two-hundred or more calories in just one sitting.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I won\u2019t even go into the mindless eating that we don\u2019t even think about like grazing in the pantry, licking the spoons as we cook, trying samples of other peoples food, etc.\u00a0 So if we added one-hundred little calories a day without even thinking about it, then it would be as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">100 Calories per day X 365 days per year<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">365 X 100 = 36,500\/3500 per pound and viola we have gained ten pounds!<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now if we multiply that by each decade that we live 10 x ? (however long we will allow this to happen) .. You get the point.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So if you want to be slimmer or maintain your weight as you age then you might want to do the following simple steps:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li>Reduce your food intake by one-hundred calories (preferably two-hundred) per day.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Reduce your total calories if you are a woman to 1200. This takes the ability to count calories for about a month until you are a pro and then you won\u2019t have to think twice about it.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>If you drink wine, alcohol, etc. cut it in half. Sodas, eliminate them and drink unsweet tea sweetened with Stevia (a natural sweetner which tastes fantasti\u00ad\u00adc) or lot's of water with lemon.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>If you go over then subtract from the next day.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Drink a large glass of warm water with lemon or lime before eating and during a meal.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Eat a ton of vegetables rather than fruits and refined foods and eat lean protein.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>If you go over then walk for thirty minutes in ten minute intervals if you hate working out. Every one can walk for ten minutes. If you are disabled then you will have to reduce your calories by at least a hundred or so more.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>When you eat out, ask the waiter to box half of the food to go or ask for a box and do it yourself before you eat. You\u2019ll have your next meal and only half the calories.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Consume more low calories soups and drink\/eat them throughout the day.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Whenever I\u2019m hungry, I tend to want to eat everything in site but I have found that, when I drink a cup of warm broth several times a day, it settles my stomach and makes me less hungry thus, reducing my desire to binge or over eat. I think it\u2019s the warmth that makes the difference.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With these little food hacks, you will lose weight however, it will take some time.\u00a0 But giving up a hundred or two calories a day isn\u2019t all that bad.\u00a0 It\u2019s definitely better then those fad diets of fasting, no carbs, or juicing all day, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember this will take some time but once you do this, you will see weight loss over time but this is\u00a0A way to easily lose a few pounds!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you really want to speed it up, add some workouts too!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">A way to easily lose a few pounds!<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to lose five pounds<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to lose ten pounds<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to lose weight fast<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/44052274_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":7020,"slug":"do-you-resist-yourself","type":"post","title":"DO YOU RESIST YOURSELF?","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">DO YOU RESIST YOURSELF?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are there things that you wish you would do, wished you would have done or, because time is quickly running out, you will never do? Do you distract yourself with phone calls, the Internet, friends and chaos, anything that keeps you from doing what you were meant to be doing? You were meant to be doing meaning, doing what God put you on this earth to do and doing what your spirit drives you to do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe you don\u2019t think you know what that is. Everyone has at least a few things they are good at and even some things that they excel at, at least one of them. The problem is we resist what we need to do to find out who we were meant to be. Do you resist who you were meant to be?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are probably wondering what the heck I am talking about and maybe thinking, <em>Where is the writer going with this?<\/em> Or saying to yourself, <em>I don't resist anything, but I live each day and do what I need to do<\/em>. What exactly is resistance? Did you know that doctors estimate that eighty percent of their patients come in with non-health-related issues? We are not sick, but dramatic!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes I said it. We are dramatic and doctors have to treat our drama like we have a medical condition, even when they can see that we may not. Even when we too know that we do not. We need attention, and with this attention we avoid what is happening in our lives. We go outside of ourselves for justification to keep resisting who we are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We want validation for why we resist in the first place and that\u2019s why we look outside of ourselves. If we are preoccupied, then we can continue to resist what we must do. Resistance can mean something as small as staying in the bathtub for too long when you know you should be getting ready to leave to try to be more productive at work. Or, it can be as big as putting off larger responsibilities that never get done. There is a price, whether big or small, when resisting life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of us go from this condition to that condition; one gets cured and another one occurs. This is how we resist. We have one crisis after another and another but the drama, or the condition we have, is still <em>resistance,<\/em> which keeps repeating itself. If we don\u2019t get out of our own way, we will get stuck. And the reason we get stuck is because we resist the art of who we are meant to be. Art is what we are put on this earth for.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am not talking about the kind of art as in painting or sculpting. This art is the gift of creation that we all possess. It\u2019s different for everyone, but we all have it inside. By resisting, we avoid our true self and we cultivate and create conditions or situations so that we keep going in circles. That\u2019s why many of us get nowhere . . . well, at least where we imagine ourselves to be. Not to say having a successful life of some sort is a bad thing. The difference is having the courage and the commitment to completely have the life you dream of.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we resist who we are meant to be, we manipulate the world around us. We live in the victim mode, which is the antithesis of doing the work necessary to become who we are meant to be. If you are living like this, stop and take a good look at yourself, and if there is something you have always wanted to do or someone you have always wanted to be, stop resisting it and give in and do the work necessary to get there. You will find it is much easier to stop resisting than it is to take the steps to get there.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have all heard that it takes more work to pretend to work than it does to actually do the work. I have always believed that most of us wouldn\u2019t resist if we knew what steps to take in the first place. I also believe that if we did know, many of us would have already created a better life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no formula for it either, only action. Sure, there are those who are born with a gift and they are on a journey from the time they are born. But for most of us, it\u2019s a journey of discovery. That\u2019s the key, it\u2019s a journey of discovery. It takes one step at a time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn\u2019t have to be difficult, but because we think it will be we allow resistance to kick in and we throw in the towel, and then only dream of who we could be. Worse, we burden others with our stories of what we would have done or will do someday. No one wants to hear a story other than his or her own. The best way to show others our stories is to talk the talk and walk the walk.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">a better life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to get things done<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to stop resisting yourself<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">procrastination<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">what are you waiting for?<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/23988851_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":7019,"slug":"the-five-huge-mistakes-women-look-older-and-how-to-correct-them","type":"post","title":"The Five Mistakes That Make Women Look Older","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Five Mistakes That Make Women Look Older\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>And How To Correct Them!<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Five Mistakes That Make Women Look Older.\u00a0<\/strong>Besides not smoking, drinking too much or, eating too much sugar, a lot of the way we age is in our own hands!\u00a0 Yep!

It's normally inactive within us but when it's active it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Red wine is loaded with Resveratrol and found in the skin of the grapes. &nbsp;The Resveratrol protects the skin of the grapes from fungus and bacteria.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another way to turn the longevity gene on is to \"stay hungry\" eating a lot of food turns the gene off and dieting (eating fewer calories) turns it on. &nbsp;It's called calorie restriction.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking a monkeys in a controlled study, the monkeys that took in less calories than the second group who got to eat what they wanted, looked younger, had fewer health problems and lived longer than the \"chunky monkeys.\" &nbsp;Pound for pound the lighter monkeys do much better.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A hungry life turns on our genetic survival switch and appears to lead to a longer life. So there is a survival advantage for to live on a calorie restrictive diet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have to say that I am going to try this however, as I write this it's about lunch time for me and I'm starving just by thinking that I will restrict my calories but, it's worth it to try it as I like to do things that keep me healthy and not fad diets and supplements, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me know what you think and you'll try it.<\/p>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">See the 60 Minutes Video Below:<\/p>\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qNanExS_bos\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Do you want to look and feel younger?

You have major cellular damage.\u00a0 If this happens your cells won\u2019t be able to reproduce which in turn ages you and causes death.\u00a0 The best way to avoid this is to be in the protection mode by supplementing our diets.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Antioxidants are like worker ants for our bodies.\u00a0 We need essential nutrients and we need phytochemicals.\u00a0 Essential nutrients are what we absolutely have to have to wake up and stay alive.\u00a0 These are: A, C and E (antioxidants), antioxidant minerals such as copper, selenium and zinc.\u00a0 These minerals scavenge free radicals.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next is, essential fatty acids and amino acids.\u00a0 These do double duty by being an antioxidant and strengthening our membranes so we can fight viruses.\u00a0 They are not made by our bodies so we have to get them from our diets.\u00a0 Unlike essential nutrients, phytochemicals are not required for survival.\u00a0 However, the nutrients that we get from plants are essential in order to protect ourselves from a degenerative disease.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have cells like T lymphocytes and macrophages that digest free radicals.\u00a0 They get rid of viruses, bacteria, allergens, and pollution.\u00a0 They do this before trouble begins.\u00a0 Thus, we have the protection mode.\u00a0 Next is the repair defense mode. From fixing minor dings to replacing entire cells, the repair must occur rapidly and efficiently.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The slower the rate of repair the faster we age and die.\u00a0 The rate of repair must be the same as the rate of damage.\u00a0 There is an exception to repair and it\u2019s our DNA.\u00a0 When we damage our DNA, it\u2019s a direct damage to our genetic code and, without this being intact, a cell can\u2019t do its job to repair or replicate itself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When this happens, the message to our body becomes scrambled.\u00a0 A failure like this translates to aging and death. Regeneration is when a cell dies and our body replaces the cell with an exact replica. Renewal is our bodies healing system.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">cancer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">free radical damage<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">healthy living<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">heart disease<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to live disease free<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">live longer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">live to be 100<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 70<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">renew your body<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">super charge our healing system<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/20959515_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":333,"slug":"the-anti-aging-way-to-eat-part-2","type":"post","title":"THE ANTI-AGING WAY TO EAT (Part #2)","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">THE ANTI-AGING WAY TO EAT (Part #2)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With today\u2019s American diet, we may be losing the battle to create cell renewal by eating processed foods, pesticides, foods whose vitamins have been depleted, saturated fats and sugar.\u00a0 These foods create free radicals and little nutrition to our cells.\u00a0 Foods like meat, dairy products, \u00a0fried foods and, fast foods, taste good and, they satisfy but, they shorten our life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To counter the effects of the American diet and, to provide us with the necessary nutrients to our cells, it is advisable to eat a low-fat and vegetarian diet and, supplement with vitamins and minerals.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our cells are where everything that goes into our mouth ends up and, they have a purpose even if we are not mindful at the time we are shoving a donut down the hatch.\u00a0 If our cells could talk, they would not allow us to eat unhealthy, but instead, guide us as we eat, in the right direction to optimize our cells.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Until they can talk, it is up to us to improve our diets therefore, improving our life span.\u00a0 We may be able to live to 100 and beyond without degenerative disease if we make an effort to.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allow me to give you a few examples of how some of what we put into our mouths can have some pretty detrimental effects to our cells.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take wine for example.\u00a0 I love wine and I probably drink too much of it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alcohol hurts our cells.\u00a0 Our livers can clone cells to keep up with it (in moderation) but, when nerve cells die, and then we produce no more.\u00a0 If our kidneys had their choice, they would ask you to drink only purified water because they already have to filter out the entire body, by consuming tap water; they have the added job of having to fight off toxic chemicals, etc.\u00a0 The pancreas has to handle the sugar in our bodies.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn\u2019t like it when we pour down loads of processed sugar. We have immune cells called lymphocytes and they need fewer animal fats and more essential fatty acids.\u00a0 They need this so they can strengthen our membranes.\u00a0 They protect against viruses.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s wise to pass over the butter, margarine and hydrogenated oils.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not to worry however, I am not saying you have to avoid eating, drinking (oh and breathing), but, the goal is to reduce free radicals and to avoid chemicals as much as you can to live a longer and more healthy life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We just don\u2019t want to overload our bodies to the point or to any point, that it becomes overloaded at any given time.\u00a0 The renewal way to eat is to choose grains, legumes, fruits and, vegetables.\u00a0 We must lose foods from animal sources as they invite heart disease, cancer and many degenerative diseases.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was surprised when I had my heart checked and told my heart doctor that I was eating wild fish, now, after being a vegan for many years.\u00a0 I thought he would be happy for me because I had come to believe that fish is excellent for our hearts, brains and bodies.\u00a0 To my surprise he said, \u201cThere is no beneficial reason for me to eat fish.\u201d\u00a0 He explained that fish was being pushed as an alternative to red meat eaters, and that was better for them, however, for me, it was healthier to continue on a vegan diet.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who knew?\u00a0 It\u2019s mind boggling how you hear one thing and then shortly after it\u2019s the opposite.\u00a0 Who knows what to believe these days?\u00a0 With that being said, I like to give more weight to things that make common sense that to some scientic facts that come along.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It would seem like more common sense and more healthy to eat a plant based diet rather that our red meat, processed, French fried diet that Americans are living on now.\u00a0 We can\u2019t act like its not ruining our arteries, because deep down inside we know the truth so why delay?\u00a0 Pay now or pay later.\u00a0 But, one way or the other, we will pay the price of bad eating with poor health.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Weight Loss<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">diabetes<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be healthier<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to eat better<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to eat healthy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to use food as medicine<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the anti aging way to eat<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/44130693_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":331,"slug":"the-anti-aging-way-to-eat-part-1","type":"post","title":"THE ANTI-AGING WAY TO EAT (Part #1)","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">THE ANTI-AGING WAY TO EAT<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you understand that you must consume antioxidants and adequate supplies of nutrients, you will have the knowledge to create meals that include the essentials required to renew your cells.\u00a0 There are about six nutrients that will accommodate the renewal process.\u00a0 If anyone one these are lacking then the renewal process will slow down conversely, if all of them are highly functioning, the process will speed up with the goal of a healthy and disease free body. These nutrients are:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Amino Acids<\/u><\/strong> which are enzymes and enzymes are proteins.\u00a0 These proteins are building blocks.\u00a0 It is best to get these by consuming whole grains and beans rather than by consuming meats.\u00a0 Meat and other animal based products are acidic and they cause free radicals in the body, whereas whole grains and beans do not.\u00a0 Plant based foods are neutralizers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Complex Carbohydrates <\/u><\/strong>provide energy to our cells.\u00a0 Again, unrefined, whole grains and beans offer the best quality.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be fooled by natural sugars because they undermine the cells ability to regenerate by fueling your body with junk instead of clean fuel.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Essential Fatty Acids<\/u><\/strong> are the fat vitamins that serve as building blocks for our cells membranes.\u00a0 They are free radical killers and they enhance our body\u2019s immune system.\u00a0 Essential fatty acids are used by the body as an anti-inflammatory protector.\u00a0 Foods like seeds, beans and vegetables have minimal amounts of essential fatty acids however, for the optimal amount needed; we can supplement our diet with flax seed and borage oil.\u00a0 Fish oil is another good source.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Vitamins and Minerals <\/u><\/strong>are needed to help with the chemical process of our bodies.\u00a0 For example when we talk about antioxidants which are the scavengers that eat free radicals, we are relating to vitamins such as A, C and E.\u00a0 With regard to minerals, these are cofactors that help our enzyme systems, thus helping our enzymes perform the tasks necessary to renew our cells.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Phytochemicals <\/u><\/strong>These are the difference between basic nutrition and super nutrition.

You can\u2019t cry because you can\u2019t feel anything. You are so numb you can barely move, but you get yourself up and make it to your car.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After who knows how long, you sit in your car and you begin to talk to God. Your life flashes by and you wonder how you will tell your family the news. You say, \u201cGod, how could you do this to me?\u201d \u201cHow could you let me die when I am not ready to? I am too young to die.\u201d You begin to bargain with God.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lottery ticket is the furthest from your mind at this point. You tell God you will do anything if he will let you live. \u201cLet me live to love my kids, my grandkids, let me keep my life. Please don\u2019t let me die, God, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You feel the presence of God in your car and he allows you to know what he thinks about your plea for a moment, and then says, \u201cI will make a deal with you. I will let you live but you have to give up your lottery ticket. You will no longer be rich and I will give you your life back. You must go back to the life you had.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You don\u2019t blink, you don\u2019t even think twice, and you say, \u201cYes, yes, yes! I will give up all materials and money to have my life back.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">YOUR LIFE BACK? The one you already have right now. The one you didn\u2019t appreciate when you bought the lottery ticket. The not-so-good life you had when you bought the lottery ticket so you could escape the life you now want back. The one you would give anything to have again.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Would you die for that new life? Or would you give back the lottery ticket to keep the life you have now? You don\u2019t have to die for what is already in your hands.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You have already won the lottery because you have your health and, therefore, you have your life. The gift that no money can buy, and you already own it. You don\u2019t have to wish for it, you don\u2019t have to long for it, you only need to be thankful to have it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fortune of health is, therefore, your precious life. Appreciate it, because it won\u2019t last forever, and it too will be gone in a blink. Next time, God may not bargain with you. On this day, you are a winner. Go out and enjoy your prize. You are your jackpot!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No one person\u2019s, or generation\u2019s time is more valuable than the other. Time is just as important to any of us, no matter what age we are. We can go and be who we have always wanted to be, we have a job to do, a calling to enact and a self to become. If you were born to paint, it is your job to be a painter. It is your job to be what you were born to be.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I hope you are where you have always wanted to be, but if not, then ask yourself, why not?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we're old and near the end, we\u2019ll go home and start again.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Thank you so much for reading this blog and sharing your time with me. \u00a0You have enriched my life just because you have allowed me to do what I love.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">0ver 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">death<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy at middle-age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be rich<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">lottery<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 70<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 80<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">winning the lottery<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/lottery.jpg"},{"id":320,"slug":"320","type":"post","title":"","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">LONGEVITY AND HAPPINESS #1<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are all on one heck of a journey in life, and to make it to this point in good health, and with a hopeful outlook, says a lot about how great we are aging. We need to put the superficial second to the physical and emotional in our lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right now, and from here on out, we should consider our longevity instead of our wrinkles. Think about it, if you could look absolutely stunning, but not have the physical and mental abilities to go with it, would that be better?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Honestly, I would rather be healthy and in shape with some wrinkles and sagging skin than the alternative, and I certainly don\u2019t want to be eighteen and clueless either. Who gets to decide how we are supposed to age and how we should look: the media?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After all, they are the ones that give us harmful feedback about aging in the first place. Who are they to us anyways? When\u2019s the last time your partner or a friend, said you looked bad? If they\u2019re a good friend or companion, they will only see how beautiful you are.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We receive negative information from the time we are young girls, and then it\u2019s reinforced by the media by placing unrealistic and negative expectations upon us. Then we perpetuate the lie by thinking we can measure up to this picture. We can\u2019t achieve this image; no one ever does or ever will, as it\u2019s a lie, and the truth we have inside of us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We don\u2019t need to go outside of ourselves to validate who we are. We know who we are and we certainly don\u2019t need the media or any magazine telling us. If we could all step up to the plate and admit that we do love ourselves in spite of what we compare ourselves to, just think how content we would become. We are all unique and no one knows you like you do, not even your spouse. This is the key; get to know yourself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I read a great book in which the author wrote, \u201cWhy should other people try to know who you are when you don\u2019t even know yourself?\u201d If you think about that statement, you can see it may be true for you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We want our spouse, our kids, and our friends to know what and who we are, but do we really know who we are and what we want? For me, I am still trying to figure this out by taking the first step to quick assuming that others know what I am thinking. I am the only one who knows what I am thinking, and I am the only one who knows what I want; therefore, if I want a happier life with others and with myself, I must be a better communicator instead of a criticizer of others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Life takes work, we all know that, but it doesn\u2019t have to be hard work. Real change and happiness begins with acknowledging the things we can change and ignoring the things that we can\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Situations in life may bother us when we can\u2019t change the outside world, but rather than hold in the conflict, ask yourself, \u201cWhat is it about this part of me that is making me feel this way?\u201d Then ask, \u201cHow can I make peace with it?\u201d Don\u2019t forget, there are plenty of aspects of our lives that should make us feel proud, no matter what age you are. Need I go into them?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Look at yourself and see who you will be in ten or twenty years. The goal should be to make peace with aging and choose to be happy. Live in the moment and feel the experience of life, because it doesn\u2019t last very long.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember, as you got older, you looked back at pictures of yourself and saw how good you looked and how happy your were, but you didn\u2019t appreciate it at the time? Leave the past and embrace the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Before you go, I created \"The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\" In just seven<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><em>https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/em><\/a><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/placeholder-image.jpg"},{"id":316,"slug":"be-your-best-at-any-age","type":"post","title":"BE YOUR BEST AT ANY AGE","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BE YOUR BEST AT ANY AGE<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who knows what the fountain of youth is. We all know aging catches up with us very quickly. They say, the older you get, the faster you age. It\u2019s as though we wake up one day and something\u2019s changed!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You\u2019re rocking along in your life looking and feeling great and then suddenly, out of nowhere, reality hits you; you can\u2019t do the same things or look the same as you did. Never fear, contrary to what we have been told, there are things we can do to slow down the aging process and keep ourselves on top of our game, and to, as the say, \u201cage gracefully.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as I am concerned, beauty companies are liars! And we all know they are not anti-aging us, but putting moisture on top of our skin and taking our money. Like the Oil of Olay commercial says, \u201cDo you still have wrinkles even after the wrinkle cream is gone?\u201d The fact of the matter is, we are going to go through many changes with our mind, body and appearance.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unless you have a fortune to pay for plastic surgery (even that doesn\u2019t look good after a while), you will be like the rest of women. Your skin will age and your body fat will shift to places you never would have imagined.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your shape will change, your health will change and, suddenly, you will have to make quick modifications in order to work with what you have. Don\u2019t be sad, it happens to all of us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it fair? Heck no. Can we do much about it, very little. The sooner we accept that we will age no matter what, the sooner we can move along and find peace and look our best at any age for the age we are at the time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I could tell you one thing that will anti-age you, and it doesn\u2019t cost you a dime, and it\u2019s probably the closest to the fountain of youth you will ever know, would you want to know about it?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Of course you do<\/em>, so here it is!!! EXERCISE! That\u2019s it! Exercise at least five days a week. You will keep your weight down and your butt where it is, and even improve upon it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It will keep the blood pumped to your skin giving you a natural glow. People lose thirty percent of their muscle strength between the ages of fifty and seventy, and then lose another thirty percent for each decade thereafter.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alarming, if you think about it, because we need good muscle tone. We need to work out for balance and mobility as we get older. \u00a0It will be even more important to maintain muscle tone as we become elderly.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reason staying active is more important than ever is it keeps us coordinated so we don\u2019t fall and break a hip, and it keeps the neurons in our brains firing. We need to keep our brains active to avoid dementia and to remember things like names of people, which I am very bad at. You don\u2019t have to hit the gym and run ten miles, or take a cardio spinning class until you pass out.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019m simply talking about walking, riding a bike, swimming, or taking a dance class, and definitely lift weights to keep your muscle tone and bones strong. Whatever you do, you must also wear sunscreen everyday, as the sun is the number one reason we get wrinkles!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For me, I work out, and I take in one gram of protein for every pound I weigh, and I also take supplements daily. Although I do have my bad habits, like drinking wine daily, I justify this by taking exceptionally good care of myself the rest of the time, as in eating organic, very little carbs and drinking a ton of water.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t forget to go to the doctor yearly, and get your mammogram, too. I know we can only control, and so do, so much to ward off disease and remain energetic and the rest is, just what will be what it is. Our cells are programmed genetically to die at a certain point and there is nothing we can do about that. However, don\u2019t underestimate environment verses biology.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are in more control of our outcome then we give ourselves credit for. The goal may not be to live forever, but to forever live while we are here.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get a free cheat sheet to get your \u00a0workout without killing yourself. \u00a0Click the link below.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/how-to-get-your-daily-workout\/\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/how-to-get-your-daily-workout\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">age well<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">disease<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to age well and look good<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">look good at any age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">look good for your age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over70<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/43933577_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":294,"slug":"should-you-age-naturally-or-get-procedures-done","type":"post","title":"Should you age naturally or get procedures done?","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Should you age naturally or get procedures done?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yesterday I got Fraxel Laser on my face. \u00a0I was excited to think that my thick textured skin could possibly be eliminated by burning off the top layer of my skin.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While that may have been exciting to think that I would have nicer and even younger looking skin, when I woke up this morning I looked like I had been in a fire.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even worse, when the furniture delivery guys came, they had a look of shock when I answered the door! \u00a0I could see that they were very uncomfortable so I relieved their tension by telling them I had been in a freak accident!!\u00a0Okay, I told them that I had laser on my face. \u00a0They weren't amused.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn't go to work today let alone out in public because I know people will look and people will ask \"What the hell happened to your face?\" \u00a0I know this because I always do things to my face and people looked and people asked!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One day, I bought a skin peel online, a peel that no regular person such as myself without a medial license should have been able to purchase, and I used that peel and gave myself third degree burns under my eyes, and along my nose. \u00a0It was not pretty and I had to hide under a cap for about three months.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Long story short, my journey for younger skin went from trying to get rid of my wrinkles to searching for a plastic surgeon to undo the damage that I had done.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was about four years ago and there wasn't much the doctor could do. \u00a0In time the scars have lightened but in no way are they gone. \u00a0A constant reminder that in the wrong hands, chemicals can do some serious damage when you don't know what your're doing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Did I learn a lesson? \u00a0Yep, and that is for most of the stuff that wounds, let a professional do it. \u00a0But, will I ever stop anti-aging?

If you can do something about it, do it now and do it quick, but don\u2019t dwell on it. Whatever the past was, it doesn\u2019t equal the future and the future is now. There is no reason not to forgive ourselves for whatever mistakes we have made in the past even if they were made only by omission.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to grow old, we must not fear growing old. The biggest problem that we all have, both men and women, is fear. We are afraid to live, to be alive, and to risk being ourselves.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing defines us like death, and yet death is not our greatest fear, but genuinely living is the real fear. We have all had bad luck, bad breaks, heartbreak, or things didn\u2019t turn out the way we wanted them, however, we and the world still keep going.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have to, we have no choice, but we continue to hold in pain and, with every breath, we don\u2019t let it out. We have to let go of pain and release it along with the blame and guilt. If you can\u2019t do this then you owe it to yourself, and to those who love you, to make peace with yourself so that you can fully live and love those around you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Hormones<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Hormones<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">compassionate<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">coping<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">disease<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">forgiveness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">free yourself<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">Free yourself to let go and grow old compassionately.<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">getting old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to forgive<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to get old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">passionate<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">wrinkles<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/40438945_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":286,"slug":"born-for-what-part-3-my-final","type":"post","title":"Born for What? Part #3 My final","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Born for What? Part #3 My final<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are humans with brains, and if one person can create a distinct\u00ad life, then shouldn\u2019t another human being be able to do the same? Why then do some people live in the depths of hell never to rise up, to know anything else?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Life is peculiar\u00ad\u00ad sometimes, and, again, one has to wonder if everything is prearranged and we really don\u2019t have any control of who we are or where we will go.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We may think we do by staying busy or getting on with life, but are we really just passing the time instead? Maybe God wanted us all to do something different and what we are doing is exactly what we were put here to do and nothing more.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For some reason I think there is more to this because humans are miracles in and of themselves and, like Stephen Hawking, are we doing all we can with the miracle we were given?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer I come up with as to why we don\u2019t become all that we can be is because of fear. I will say that Stephen Hawking has a genius mind that puts most of us at a disadvantage (doesn\u2019t seem right to use that word when we are talking about the horrific nature of living with ALS), however, even with a genius mind, conversely, many of us who have abled bodies and intelligent minds don\u2019t do more than what is necessary.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stephen Hawking used his mind to overshadow his disability and not the reverse. Many of us don\u2019t do more than we are capable of, and it\u2019s more than just being lazy, it\u2019s that we are afraid of something, something we don\u2019t want to confront so that we can live in a comfort zone, or, even worse, uncomfortably because it\u2019s more painful to try to move beyond it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fear is the reason we are not all that we can be. Somewhere along the way, for those of us who are lost, fear was the beginning element in our journey that brought us here. We stay in many situations because of fear, and humans will do more to avoid pain than they will to gain pleasure. \u00a0We dream about the life we want but it's sometimes too painful to have.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do we get off track and become lost souls, while our fate and inner being should be moving another way, the predestined way created by our higher power? Do our outer personalities want something different, thus the reason we lose our way? Which one is right? In other words, are we fighting a losing battle when we are lost?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My cousin and I talked the other day about how concerned we both were about her brother. He was leaving weird messages for my cousin and his daughter and me. His comments were bizarre. Though he may have some kind of mental illness, undiagnosed but clearly realized by others, he was managing himself okay.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He had a job and some sort of relationship with others. But he was still struggling with life, the kind of struggles that I don\u2019t understand, but which others and I can see.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The kind of struggles where you quietly ask yourself, <em>Why does this person continue to make life hard on himself? Why doesn\u2019t he just make the right choice and life would be easy?<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wonder why it\u2019s so hard for those who struggle to exist, who remain lost, to live a life without suffering, to merely make the right choice, the choices I would make to stop the suffering, and the ones I see so clearly in front of me.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have come to realize that my cousin can\u2019t see the easy choice in front of him, because it\u2019s not so easy at all. Those who may be lost don\u2019t see any choices at all. The only choice they see is the one that keeps them suffering like a perpetual hell they can\u2019t escape from.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For them, they have no choice but the choice to wake up and suffer each day like the one before. Do they want to agonize and endure a life of pain and punishment? I don\u2019t think so; who would want pain and suffering?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those who are lost create a painful life for themselves and maybe it\u2019s so they can feel at least something. They may procrastinate, resist, lash out and create chaos as a protection method to stay and justify where they are. They are comfortable being uncomfortable; it\u2019s all they know. The un-comfort ability of being in agony has now become their security. The unknown is more painful.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am tired of seeing people who are lost in this world because it hurts my heart, especially when I can\u2019t help them. People who are born into and go through life with one bad situation after another only to suffer and never see, feel or realize any happiness is a sad thing to watch.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s as though the world is a holding pattern for them until they get to the next one. It\u2019s even as though they were accidentally born before their time, therefore, they need to wait this life out in order to cross through and make the transition to do it again only, hopefully, the next one will be a more kind one.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am hoping this was the case for my brother Chris. I hope he is happy now and I hope his body is perfect. I hope he is smiling now. I know I am not supposed to say that someone who was born wasn\u2019t meant to be born, that\u2019s just silly.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every soul is important, especially one that had the chance to fight to be born. But is this really true? If this were true, why do we see so much suffering? Is suffering just a thought process, meaning, I am not suffering in my life because I made a choice not to? Are we a product of ourselves, but blame our circumstances.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know my cousin wants to be loved and I know he wants to be included, but he can\u2019t because every time he is loved and included, he sabotages himself by not respecting those around him, and then others alienate him, therefore casting him back into his dark world.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this point, he believes it\u2019s others who have the problem and that no one likes or cares about him. What he doesn\u2019t understand is that others do want to include him in their lives but he makes it impossible to the point where, unless those around him want to be miserable, they back away and stay in a place where they can grow, even if he doesn\u2019t want to.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Really, I don\u2019t think he knows or even thinks he is damaging his relationships with others through his words and his actions. To him, he is just himself and, because of this, it\u2019s everyone else who has a problem.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In his world, he is the victim and lives in the victim world. He knows nothing different; therefore he is alone with himself while others avoid him. He is now isolated and lonely and he blames others for what they do to him, the past, the future and for whatever is not creating congruence in his life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He knows no different and has no tools to be anyone other than himself, the self that no one understands, and not even he does. We all know these types of personalities. They are not bad people whatsoever; they just don\u2019t have the tools, may never have the tools or will not accept the tools to see another way of looking at the world other than their own way.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many among us who are not so blessed in life. Even those who have a privileged life can be eluded by events and circumstances in life. Sometimes the delusion is our own self-doing, or maybe it\u2019s something beyond what we can see or comprehend.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We may be born into money, have highly intelligent parents, we can even be extremely intelligent ourselves, however, there is a pulling force from somewhere in the cosmos, somewhere in Karma, maybe somewhere from a past life, whatever it may be or, whatever we may call it, and that something takes a certain percentage of us away and sucks us into a life of eternal defeat and darkness, even if it is in our own minds.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of us hide behind things to avoid suffering by creating an illusion in life and we choose never to see the truth, we just exist in life. But, to merely exist is living a life without existence.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By the way, the picture along with this blog post is my little brother Chris who died last June at the age of 44 and on his birthday. \u00a0He walked this earth very much depressed and alone and, in the end, I guess God decided he shouldn't suffer anymore.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I talked to him the day before, \u00a0I gave him a long hug and told him I loved him. \u00a0He died in his sleep that night. \u00a0When I got the call, although I had some peace that he wasn't suffering with lonliness and spiritual pain anymore, I still closed my eyes and wish he'd had a better life while he was here.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Peace :) Thank you for reading my three part blog post on \"Born for What\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 9.6pt 0in; text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">born for what<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">destiny<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">fear<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">finding your path<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">god<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">higher power<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">living in fear of life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">lost souls<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">purpose<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">stephen hawking<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">what am I here for<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Chris_Brandi2-400x280.jpg"},{"id":254,"slug":"born-for-what-part-2-2","type":"post","title":"Born for what? Part #2","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are those who walk among us who have never been in the right place at the right time. In fact, there is never a right place or a right time for them, as every time and every place they land is not right. They drift, they get lost and they go through life with one setback after another.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Disasters always occur, tragedies happen, and they are always waiting for the next interference that will affect their lives. They wait for it and it always shows up just as they had expected it would. These are the people who live their entire lives never to find happiness and never to feel authentic joy. Contentment is a word they will never know.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They look at others as being more fortunate than they are, and this reinforces their beliefs that they are not good enough and don\u2019t deserve what others have. I once heard someone say that they didn\u2019t deserve Christmas presents. Though this sounds so trivial, this person really meant it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He is the nicest person with the biggest heart, and believe me, if anyone was deserving, he certainly was. It broke my heart to see someone in such pain who thought he wasn\u2019t worthy of even a single gift. And it\u2019s not the Christmas presents that are the gift, but the love of those who wanted to give him the gifts that mattered. \u00adUnfortunately, that was my own son.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Throughout the years, I haven\u2019t always had the best life, but I have had a lot of lucky breaks, and I had many people along the way who wanted to help me for some reason or another. I realize that I have been very blessed, and this is one of those circumstances where luck comes in.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For whatever reason I, unlike my brother, have been helped, encouraged and handed things without having to ask. For this, I am very fortunate. I know this isn\u2019t the case for a lot people, and for some they have rough and difficult lives. Sometimes, even when those who are lost and have the support around them, they still flounder and have difficult and troubled lives.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their lives on earth are troubled and painful. For those people, only they know their pain. We who appear to be strong will never comprehend the pain they are in. We may say, \u201cCheer up, what\u2019s wrong, why can\u2019t you be happy?\u201d And all they really want is to be all of those things, and in fact, they want it more than we know.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For some of us, it\u2019s pretty easy to get up, get dressed, breeze over to the coffee pot and think about how great our day will be. For others, just getting out of bed and facing the day is daunting, and not because they are depressed, although they could be, but because they see the world as just another day to get through, and they see no joy, have no hope and have nothing to look forward to. It may be all in their thinking, but they are thinking it just the same.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know that I am fortunate, and I try to never forget that I am very blessed to have good health and to be a person of sound mind. I believe that if you have these two things, you can have a good life. I know through disease, genetics and outside forces, life and circumstances can change this in a blink of an eye.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we are born, is our fate already decided? Are we born with a blank slate and unlimited choices to become whoever we desire to be? Or, is fate predestined, and we are not born with unlimited choices at all, but only a limited number of choices that have already been laid out for us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it this dynamic that is the reason why some people fall victim to themselves, the environment, disease or something that doesn\u2019t allow them to live in the light, but rather keep them in the dark?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s as though some of us live in a constant hell because we are desperately trying to escape who we were destined to be. The question becomes: are troubled lives merely a product of fighting what was meant to be?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One would have to ponder this question because there has to be a reason why others don\u2019t struggle when so many do. Think about it, many people go effortlessly through life, while others have to fight every minute of every day for some sort of existence, some sort of peace and some sort of normalcy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Part #3 continued tomorrow..<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">lost souls<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">mental illness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">unhappiness<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/resistancecover-400x280.jpg"},{"id":245,"slug":"born-for-what-part-1","type":"post","title":"Born for what? Part #1","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">BORN FOR WHAT<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Too many times I see people needlessly suffer and I ask myself if their suffering is really necessary. Is it they who cause the suffering, or is it because they have some seriously bad luck? Or worse, has Fate dealt them a terrible hand that their souls must endure until they die, and only then they will have freedom?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are some people put on Earth to suffer so the rest of us can learn or have meaning? Are they the unlucky ones? We could answer this question by asking another question: Is anything really luck in the first place?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure there are times when we may be in the right place at the right time, or we may pick some lotto numbers and with some extraordinary luck, we win. This is luck and it separates real life from luck.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Living a life in conflict is different from luck because many times we battle ourselves and, therefore, we create our own luck. We create fateful situations because of the way we see the world.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know I get in my own way a lot and it\u2019s because I\u2019m trying to avoid something, and I only end up creating more chaos by doing this. And then the outcome is twofold. If I had a dollar for all the times that I sabotaged myself or made things more difficult than they needed to be, honestly, I would be a millionaire by now, or at least on my way to being one.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I struggle like anyone else, only now I\u2019m more aware of my actions so I try to do it a little less. I\u2019m not perfect and I try every day to do my best; well, most of the time. I know when I\u2019m not doing my best and I know when events beyond my control are actually happening, or whether I\u2019m creating them for justification.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we are born disabled, that\u2019s not luck. No one would say, \u201cLook at that boy with MS,\u201d or \u201cLook at that lady with cancer, how unlucky.\u201d It\u2019s not because they were unlucky that they got sick, and that we are lucky because we didn\u2019t; it\u2019s a matter of timing, or it\u2019s our genetics already set in motion and it\u2019s beyond our control.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure we could argue that we are lucky or fortunate to be of good health. And that I agree with; every second that we are alive and healthy we are lucky because there are so many who are not. But it\u2019s not as though I earned my good health and those like my brother didn\u2019t.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s just what was supposed to happen at some point in life. Sometimes life isn\u2019t fair. We can say that we can\u2019t do anything about our genetics; but then there are those who would beg to differ and say that we have absolute control over them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I disagree to a point because why do kids and babies get cancer and other diseases? They never had a chance. Sure, as we grow and take care of ourselves, we can offset genetics and hopefully avoid turning on the genes that give us cancer, such as not smoking to avoid lung cancer, or staying out of the sun to avoid skin cancer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But for the most part, we can\u2019t control our fate. My brother had absolutely no control, no matter how hard he willed himself to be well, and in the end, it\u2019s what his body was meant to do. Although it\u2019s totally not fair, it is what it is.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In general, that is a true statement, but it\u2019s not whether we are in the right place at the right time. Things that are meant to be will happen to us and that\u2019s part of life. We are born and we are given life, and our genetics are the program that runs us for the most part.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luck has nothing to do with it otherwise. When we are pregnant, we don\u2019t say, \u201cI hope my luck pans out and I have a healthy baby.\u201d No, we say, \u201cPlease God, let my baby be healthy.\u201d Life, and for the most part of what happens throughout it, is out of our hands.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because life is not about luck, luck is only a bonus or a benefit; everything else is probably pre-destined. It\u2019s what we do with the life we are given that is the important thing, and this is where our will comes in, along with our choices.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choice is what separates luck from a life worth living. We can\u2019t change the environment we are born into, or how our genes will express themselves, but we can make choices that mitigate some of the circumstances we are handed.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Herein lies the choice of seeing life as full, and not empty. Look at the physicist Stephen Hawking; he is a beautiful example of a life well-lived under the most extreme circumstances. When life gave him a lemon he made more than lemonade.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just using that statement seems ridiculous because he didn\u2019t just make lemonade, he made a lemonade machine. He made the most of the situation in the life that he was given. Though he is severely disabled, suffering from a motor neuron disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and is unable to even talk, he has continued to create a lifetime of accomplishments.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And, on top of it all, he maintains a sense of humor about it. The greatest thing about Stephen Hawking is that he is defined by his accomplishments and not by his disability. We need to remember that we too are defined by what we believe and by what we do, and not for what we have or don\u2019t have, or who we are, but by how we look at ourselves and at the world. If we change our thinking, we can change our life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Please read part #2 tomorrow :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">anxiety<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">cancer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">learning to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">living with depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">lost souls<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">mental illness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">sadness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">struggle<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/mentalillness.jpg"},{"id":237,"slug":"where-women-go","type":"post","title":"Where Women Go As We Age","content":"Where Women Go As We Age\r\n\r\nWhat are we waiting for? We can\u2019t wait for the future to happen and we certainly can\u2019t live in the past. In middle age and beyond, we have to come to terms with the fact that our choices have changed.\r\n\r\nFor some, the changes may not be good, for others, aging is a time when we can do the things we have only dreamed of.\r\n\r\nI am inspired by Diana Nyad, the first women to ever swim to Florida from Cuba without a cage. This is extremely inspiring because she was a sixty-four-year-old woman!\r\n\r\nI am impressed because I know a few sixty-year-olds who believe they can\u2019t park too far away from the grocery store doors because they don\u2019t want to walk that far, let alone, swim for fifty-three hours and one hundred and ten miles.\r\n\r\nDid I mention this was her fifth attempt? Just goes to show you that we are never too old and to never stop trying no matter what. She made her first attempt when she was twenty-eight, and then in 2011, she tried three times at the age of sixty-two, and again at sixty-three.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally accomplished the swim on September 2, 2013, she had three messages for us all: one, we should never, ever give up, two, <u>you're never too old to chase your dreams,<\/u> and three, it looks like a solitary sport, but it is a team.\r\n\r\nDoesn\u2019t that sum up what we women are going through right now? Never give up on yourself, no matter what age you are. Enjoy your life, love yourself, and do what it is that feeds your soul. It\u2019s never too late to achieve and live your own personal dream. Just have the belief and do away with the fear.\r\n\r\nRemember, large or small, your dream belongs to you, and it\u2019s just as important as anyone else\u2019s. We are all living our own dream and we can create a new one if we don\u2019t like the one we are in.\r\n\r\nFinally, you are never alone. It takes a team, meaning your friends, your family, your spouse, and your faith, especially faith in yourself. Whatever it is around you that lifts you and inspires you is what you are meant to be. It is important to always be mindful, moreover, keep an open mind.\r\n\r\nYou never know when the universe is offering you a gift, and if you are not awake, then you will miss opportunities and the energy will go elsewhere.\r\n\r\nToo many times we get up, go to work, come home and then go to bed without taking even one second to appreciate the gift of life and what is has to offer us. For those of us who ask why are we here? The quick answer is to take a look around and embrace the gift of life.\r\n\r\nThe experience of being born may be the only reason we are here. We don\u2019t need to create chaos trying to make a bigger meaning than necessary, otherwise we waste the time we have. Sure it\u2019s great if you are able to leave a legacy, but even if you don\u2019t, its okay too.\r\n\r\nThe only wasted life, is a life not lived fully. What does fully mean to you? If we embrace the experience of life without thinking there is an attachment, then we are living a life that is meant to be and, therefore, we receive the blessings that come with it.\r\n\r\nThe one day I will get there is now, and it\u2019s a fork, and you must take the right path that makes you happy.\r\n\r\nOur culture teaches us that we won\u2019t ever get there; therefore, we are in a constant state of searching and wondering what\u2019s next. I hope you realize your unique beauty, and find the energy within right now, this moment. Every second counts.\r\n\r\nThis day too will pass and you will never get it back. Whatever holds you back now, you will look back in three or four years and realize how fantastic you really were. You will question why you stayed in certain states of mind, relationships, jobs or whatever held you back in the past.\r\n\r\nAs we get older, we tend to think we are more tired, especially women, because we are still thinking we can do it all. There are two kinds of energy. One is when you are tired and don\u2019t feel like doing anything. You may feel a bit down on yourself; you decide you don\u2019t have any energy to engage in life.\r\n\r\nThis energy level is the one when you haven\u2019t slept or you need to eat, so you do and you get your energy back. The second energy level is when you have slept, eaten and still, you have no energy to enjoy life or to engage with others. Perhaps dare I say the word depressed? If you ate more or slept more, you would not find your energy in this state.\r\n\r\nHowever, if suddenly your lottery ticket won or your soul mate came into your life in an instant, you would find your energy! This is the kind of energy you should strive to tap into. Wake up as though you have won the lottery of life, and you love yourself enough, more than anyone else could ever. You have the energy to live with excitement, just remove the negativity that is draining it.\r\n\r\nWe need to live in real moments in time. There is a book called <em>Real Moments<\/em> by Barbara De Angelis. If you take your life and your minutes for granted, then you should read this book. It will not only show you how to feel the sun on your face and the wind in your hair, it will show you how to live like you should before you die and actually feel like you live in the moment.\r\n\r\nI know this may sound like a circular question, but there is a difference between going through the motions and living in the moment. When you actually live in the moment, time seems to stand still and you feel every experience and sensation happening in that moment. You owe it to yourself to live this way.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to live in the moment<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">living your full life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 70<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">time<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">where women go<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/14786922_m-400x280.jpg"},{"id":231,"slug":"finding-our-purpose-at-middle-age","type":"post","title":"Finding our purpose at middle-age","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finding our purpose at middle-age<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Middle age is when we may begin to (should I dare say it?) feel old. We feel the effects of aging and begin to see our own mortality. This is the part that gets me. Sometimes at this age, it\u2019s hard to relate to those who are younger.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is when our outward appearance and the perceptions of others begin to change. This can be a scary time. I am going to say what we already know, and that is aging is not looked upon so well. The value placed on appearance in our society far outweighs the value of experience and compassion. Aging can make one feel shelved and unneeded. Even if we may sometimes feel this way, it is certainly not the truth.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may have grown tired of the relationships in your life at this stage of life. Many women stay in relationships because of the kids when they know full well they are not happy. Sometimes we stay for financial reasons.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We look ahead and fear we will be penniless on the streets and think we should stay for stability. However, many of us believe this is the right time to leave and start a new life. When someone says they don\u2019t want to leave an unhappy situation because of the fear of the unknown, I have to ask them, why don\u2019t you fear what you know?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You already know that you are unhappy, so the unknown can\u2019t be that much worse. At least when you head out into the unknown, you basically get to redesign the life you want. Staying in certainty, but living in misery, is detrimental to living a full life, and that in itself is daunting.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both men and women fear being alone. Men are more likely to find a younger version, while we are more likely to trade companionship for passion. Women are more likely to put importance on intimacy and connections with those already around them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many young people think old people are loners, and yes some are alone, but many are not. Older women and men are becoming less self-centered and more connected to others. I have always believed that we get the love we ask for, so we simply just need to ask ourselves, \u201cWhat kind of love do we want?\u201d and then put it out there for others to see and feel.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Too many times we hide the truth, because we don\u2019t want others to see the real us because we feel it makes us look vulnerable and needy. Put this kind of thinking aside. Everyone needs to be, and should be, loved in some way or another.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are different kinds of relationships, therefore, different kinds of love. One type doesn\u2019t fit everyone. The important thing is, love is love. If not in intimacy, then in whatever relationship makes us feel important, needed and respected.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women do a great job when it comes to loving and respecting others. We deserve the same in return and it's not too much to ask for.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A fear that every woman has probably thought about at least once in her life (even if you are wealthy) is becoming the bag lady or an old homeless woman. We are all aware of the recent Great Recession 2.0.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many industries, like real estate, construction, and sales, left a lot of us, who were<span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">employed, displaced, and a significant proportion of working people and their families were forced onto the streets and became homeless, or for the first time, needed to depend on the government or charities to make it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe you got through it (though, tough), or maybe it didn\u2019t affect you. If you were the latter, than you were lucky.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe we have images of homeless elderly women living on the streets and it scares the hell out of us, creating this fear and mantra in our heads that tells us, \u201cI will never be like that,\u201d all the while the fear creating turmoil in the back of our minds, reminding us that we are just a few paychecks away from being alone, on the streets and penniless.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not every woman will have enough money for retirement, but don\u2019t worry or panic. Try to put a little away each week. It will make a big difference later on. You pay your payments each month; just create an auto draft into savings each week. Out of sight, out of mind, and ultimately peace of mind.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And remember, DON\u2019T WORRY because worrying is just a waste of your precious time. The antidote to worry is to take action and try to resolve the problem as best you can and then, more importantly, move on.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Marriage<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Marriage<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">finding happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">get old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">getting older<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy as you age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/18735993_s1-300x280.jpg"},{"id":224,"slug":"how-to-handle-fading-beauty","type":"post","title":"How to handle fading beauty","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to handle fading beauty.\u00a0The truth is, in middle age, if we don\u2019t begin to find peace while aging, we better get a grip on it now! If you were always a stunning beauty, then you had fifty or more years of outside aesthetics, but know this is not your power.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your power now has to come from within. If God wills and you take care of yourself, you will hopefully have at least another thirty or forty years to live your truth within. This is when the real living begins.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This will be your new power, which has nothing to do with what\u2019s on the outside. You can\u2019t control that anymore. Maybe this is what we are really afraid of. In middle age, it\u2019s hard to control anything anymore, especially our looks and our bodies.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just try to maintain your health and remain positive, and the rest will take care of itself. How can you find your new you? Start by being kind and gentle with yourself, just like you would for a friend who came to you for advice about the fears of aging. You would never be as harsh to a friend as you are to yourself. Be your own best friend. It makes a difference.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to find out what great qualities you have other than your looks, ask your partner, your friends, and your kids about how you may have touched their lives in a positive way.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Listen to all the wonderful stories they will tell you about you. They will tell you things that will touch your heart and make you proud of who you are. Notice when they tell you about you, they never tell you about how good you looked, only about how wonderful you are or how unselfish you may be and, how much you are loved by everyone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s a great freedom to let go of the fear of aging. Once you do this, and you really accept it, a great peace will come over you. You no longer have to spend wasted time on ways to stay and look younger.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will no longer waste time comparing yourself to the younger generation or spending money on things just to keep up with the outside world. Just think about how much extra money and time you will have when you let go and age with kindness toward yourself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can now travel and do whatever you want. You are still you only better. Remember there is nothing broken about us because we have aged. We don\u2019t have to fix our face or change our bodies for anyone, only unless we want to for us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Should you choose to do anything to yourself, do it because it will make you feel better, and because you and only you want to do it. Don\u2019t let your partner talk you into or out of whatever makes you feel happy about yourself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will never fool Mother Nature, nor will you outrun aging, but if it makes you feel better than do it! You will never be here again, so make it count for you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One day we won\u2019t worry about the wrinkles we have, and what we do or don\u2019t look like, because the real worry will be about our mortality. The point here is to live and not burden ourselves about aging, because we will all age and, one day, what we look like will be the least of our concerns.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our concerns will then be about how to live each day healthy and free from pain. What used to make us uneasy about aging will hopefully only be an issue that we will have let go of so that we may enjoy the time we have left.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enjoy the time you have left. Go and do everything you want to do without fear, without judgment and without guilt.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!

How does a woman make peace with aging in a culture obsessed with youth?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn\u2019t matter what age we are, the issue may change but the focus on aging remains the same. And that focus is how to keep a youthful appearance, stay healthy and remain active.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s great for an aging woman to center around taking care of herself, but it\u2019s another matter to obsess about getting old, and, yet, at some point we all do it. I guess you could say I\u2019m lucky because my appearance was never stunning, but I felt beautiful anyways.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can age graciously by making peace with aging because I was, and still am, an ordinary woman, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s the beautiful women I feel for because they seem to be the people having the hardest time with aging.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I really believe when you are ordinary looking like myself, you age more lovely than when you have already reached your peak. However, all women get to the same place eventually, and there is no escaping it. But beauty is all relative anyway.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, I look back at pictures and see my taught skin, my shapely body, my vibrant eyes and the youth that I didn\u2019t appreciate, and I am reminded again how fast life really goes by. With this reminder, I gain a moment of happiness because I also realize I am healthy, happy and look relatively good for my age.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know life could be worse, so I don\u2019t dwell on the past or question what God has given me. It won\u2019t change where I am today or where I will be tomorrow. It would be wise to make peace with aging sooner than later just in case there is a little more work to do down the road.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Life is a creation in progress, and it shouldn\u2019t be that we are looking and waiting for the end, because that could come for anyone on any day. As we all know, there are no guarantees that we will have another day beyond this one.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have heard it said that, if you don\u2019t feel old by the time you hit fifty, you soon will. If we live long enough, half of our lives will be spent as older women. I have never thought about it like this before. When I was young, I said I wanted to live forever!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, I just want to live a good life and be happy while I am here. I don\u2019t think the answer to getting old is lying about our age, either. Some women add a few years to their age when asked, so that others might say they look good for their age.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How can this make us feel good because we, if no one else, still know how old we really are? Don\u2019t fall into the trap of being afraid to tell your age. Just making it another year is a miracle at any age, young or old.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging gracefully<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">getting old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">losing your looks<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">making peace with aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle-age woman<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">older woman<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 70<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">wrinkles<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/39808977_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":206,"slug":"sugar-ages-us","type":"post","title":"Sugar ages us","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sugar Ages Us<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sugar ages us by accelerating glucose molecules which attach themselves to proteins in the blood.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is called protein glycation and results in the production of glue like substances called AGEs (advanced glycosylation endproducts).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These accumulate in our blood and stick to organs and tissues. \u00a0This in turn creates free radical damage. \u00a0This is when wrinkling of the skin occurs and could be a large contributor to Alzheimer's disease and other forms of mental impairment.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sugar or AGE's also contributeS to heart disease by binding directly to LDL cholesterol by creating free radicals that oxidize LDL.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In general if we consume too much sugar, AGE's causes free radical damage causing accelerated aging, reduced organ capacity, and fast biological aging.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It the latest research on disease and aging, inflammation is the root cause of most disease and what causes inflammation?

I'm thinking that I will probably end up more like my mom.\r\n\r\nI also color my hair and use the straightener a little too often which makes my hair break.\r\n\r\nMy diet is really good as I only eat fish and vegetables but, I probably drink way too much wine.\r\n\r\nI know if I changed most of these things, my hair would be in much better shape but the trade off is, I kind of like my life and I can deal with my hair loss because of it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hope for Thinning Hair<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"Research continues to dispel the notion that some types of hair loss are permanent. Experts at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, for example, recently found that people who struggle with hair loss don\u2019t have dead follicle stem cells, as previously feared \u2014 just malfunctioning follicle stem cells, which may be fixable. And another study found that mice with deep skin wounds could regrow hair, sparking hope for a cure for baldness in humans.\" (http:\/\/www.everydayhealth.com\/womens-health\/woman-dealing-with-hair-loss.aspx)\r\n\r\nI think there will be a stem cell or other therapy coming very soon to stop hair loss. \u00a0It may not stop the breakage from the damage that we do to our hair but it may stop the loss at the follicle. I'll be patiently waiting :)\r\n\r\n**Please only take supplements, etc with the proper supervision of your doctor.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Diet and Health<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">fuller hair<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">hair loss<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to have fuller hair<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to have more hair<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">longer hair<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">losing hair at middle-age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">thinning hair<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/39207639_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":195,"slug":"195","type":"post","title":"MIDLIFE AWAKENING","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MIDLIFE AWAKENING<\/em><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just when I get my mind right, my body falls apart.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">--Anonymous<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whenever I heard the term midlife crisis, I always thought of a bald man in a red sports car. That\u2019s the stereo type we think of when we are younger. Rarely do we think of women in a midlife episode unless you count menopause. However, a midlife crisis can affect both men and women.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Conversely, I think of a midlife crisis the same as I do a nervous breakdown, unreasonable to put that title on anyone. To me it\u2019s more of a midlife awakening, which shouldn\u2019t lead to a crisis. A midlife crisis reminds me of the state of mind an African tribe goes into when they do a ritual.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we do feel certain undesirable states, then it\u2019s because something is out of balance in our mind, body or spirit, and it\u2019s caught up with us. The crisis could just be all the things you once pushed down that have now come up for you to deal with. The question then becomes, do we deal with it now, or do we push it down for the next fifty years?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we choose to acknowledge that which we don\u2019t deal with, than we can overcome and, therefore, move through this phase in life with grace and splendor.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When many women face menopause, it is a huge physiological change, which can alter how we look and feel, especially when it comes to our libido. Let\u2019s not mention what menopause does to our emotional state. But is it a huge change, or are we mentally changing, and focused on a new future? Maybe we should change menopause to \u201cfuture modification.\u201d They used to call it, in my mother\u2019s day, the \u201cchange.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember my mom saying, \u201cOh, she\u2019s like that because she is going through the change.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what that was as a kid, but from the tone of my mom\u2019s voice and the expression on her face, I knew it was not something that was good. I knew not to talk to whomever it was that was changing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For both men and women, middle age is a time for reflection and a time of transformation. Change is definitely the key word for women. It\u2019s time to make changes and begin to take care of our needs, hopes and desires. We need to stop feeling guilty and feel happy that we can now put ourselves first.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The key words being <em>you first<\/em>. I\u2019m not talking about being selfish by spending the grocery money on Botox, or the mortgage payment on a new piece of jewelry (although, I do know a woman who does this), but to make it okay to be about what makes your heart, soul and spirit feel free and blissful.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many women report feeling a sense of dissatisfaction in their lives in middle age, and perhaps this is why divorces peak at this time. Many women don\u2019t like the fact that their role as mother or nurturer has changed. For me, even though I love my adult kids dearly, I am ready for them to start their lives so I can do the same.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe this is where my sports car comes in. I know one thing for sure, when they do move on, I will get that much needed raise, and then I can use it to travel or for whatever I have been waiting for, or to buy that silver convertible Porsche I\u2019ve had my eye on for twenty-plus years. Ahh, I can just feel the wind in my hair and the music turned up full blast (the kind I only like).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I, like many other women, rightfully so, put other\u2019s needs first, and now it is my turn to put me first. This is exciting and thrilling to know I can do whatever I want to now. However, this is probably the time grandkids will arrive, and that\u2019s okay too. I can give them back to their parents whenever I want, and there is the beauty of getting older.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another issue women have in middle age is uncertainty in the work place. When reaching our fifties and sixties, we have fewer opportunities for advancement. Sometimes this is the age where we are dispensed for lower paid workers. I have a business degree, but I am back in school for a psychology degree because I know the psychology field, like a few others, is a field of work where it\u2019s okay to be older.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s okay being older as others may feel you have more wisdom being middle-aged, rather than the reverse in fields like sales, marketing and management. If I were to try and find a new job with my business degree, I don\u2019t think I would have much luck competing with the younger generation.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know this is just a fact of life and, like I always say, \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d Call it age discrimination or whatever you want, but until things change in our society, it\u2019s no use fighting the order. Just move on and keep your energy for better things to come. The important thing in our lives now is to keep moving in an optimistic direction and not dwelling. Dwelling and rehashing what may or may not be is the same as worrying. It\u2019s no good and it gets you nowhere.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women should continue to reinvent themselves to stay in the game, and when I say game, I don\u2019t mean to try to complete by looking younger. I mean keep yourselves fresh both mentally and physically, and don\u2019t rest on your attainments. We need to remain educated, creative, and keep up with technology, and definitely keep your social skills sharp.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn\u2019t matter if you are a doctor, a hairdresser, a teacher, or whatever. The compassion that you give to others through your kindness and your actions is what will keep good people around you with respect to employment opportunities or otherwise. If you don\u2019t maintain enthusiastic social skills, you are out of the game no matter what you do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t feel jaded, and try to be excited about your life. We should be amazed by the life we have, the choices we have, and the gift we have in front of us, and that\u2019s ourselves. We are amazing women with so much to offer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Do these 5 things daily and slow down aging by 10 years:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=17258\" width=\"123\" height=\"123\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\/\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">aging and health<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">getting old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy when you're old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">menopause<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">midlife crisis<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 70<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the change of life<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6564010_s-400x257.jpg"},{"id":191,"slug":"the-love-lives-of-women","type":"post","title":"The Love Lives of Women","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THE LOVE LIVES OF WOMEN<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">~Pearl Jam<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ah yes, the love live of women. \u00a0I can\u2019t tell you how many times I hear women say, \u201cThere are just no good ones left,\u201d or worse, \u201cI don\u2019t want a man.\u201d Is this really true? Even when in a relationship, married or not, we can get bored.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019m not saying we need a man to be happy; I just wonder if some women simply settle for not having one. I realize that at middle age, there doesn\u2019t appear to be many single and qualified men out there, and that the men we\u2019re married to have grown to be unexciting and predictable.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also realize the dating world is a different world out there.\u00a0I hear stories from women who say men don\u2019t want to commit or are disrespectful. I hear about men having multiple girlfriends and lying to them about seeing other people.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I listen to others say how lonely they are and have settled for mediocre instead of holding out for the right guy. I may not understand, but I feel for those who would like to have a partner, someone to love and to love them, but it\u2019s just not happening. I feel for those who have given up, never expecting to find love at all.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even those of us who are married, life isn\u2019t always perfect. We go through times of doubt, and question whether we want to be married, too. I think one thing is constant and that is that, the older we get, the more settled we are with ourselves. Therefore, we may be or are okay with not having a partner, and we learn to create our own happiness and, more importantly, we own it and it feels good.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Today, I took lunch to a past neighbor who is elderly and just out of the hospital after hip replacement surgery. She lives alone, has no family, lost her job due to age discrimination, and it is highly unlikely she will ever find another job at her age.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She has no money except Social Security and divides a Dollar General store soup into two meals to survive. I asked her how old she was, and she said she is seventy-six. I asked her if she wished she was married and how it felt be alone. I asked if she was afraid. She told me she would never want to be married for the sake of being married, and if she didn\u2019t have passion for a man, then she wouldn\u2019t want to just exist like a lot of people do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She also said she was very happy at this point in her life, and then genuinely laughed as though she really was. The teacher has, yet again, appeared through her by showing me that, for all she doesn\u2019t have, she is still authentically happy, while I wake up each day looking for what could be better in my life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This teacher has taught me to appreciate what I have and to stop looking for more and better. I already have it all, and there is nothing more or better I need. That\u2019s the secret: if you don\u2019t need it, there is nothing missing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em>Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em>steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/a><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging gracefully<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">dating at middle-age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">find a boyfriend<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">find a husband<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">finding love<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">gratitude<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to love again<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">loving yourself<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age. the love lives of wome<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">women<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/35736064_m-400x280.jpg"},{"id":178,"slug":"women-and-middle-age","type":"post","title":"Women and Middle-Age","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women and Middle-Age<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From a social perspective, women tend to disengage as they get older. We are told or think that we need a hobby to keep us busy, and quietly bow out of society. When past roles and relationships are replaced or lost, we need to replace them with something in order to remain satisfied.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say be a little selfish and do something extraordinary for yourself! Do something that makes you feel ecstatic once in a while, or better yet, very often! If you don\u2019t know what that is, then begin the journey to find out.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It makes a big difference to do something for your soul rather than something because you need to fill the gap in time. Don\u2019t under estimate how great it feels to jump into a car with your girlfriends and go away for the weekend, just like you did when you were younger. You remember those carefree days, don\u2019t you? If not, it\u2019s time to get back there. We have the opportunity to do that now.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For me socially, it was down to going to dinner with my husband on Friday nights, going with my daughter to dinner once or twice a month, or going with a girlfriend once in a while for, yet again, dinner.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, as a couple we\u2019d go to functions like weddings, funerals, benefits, graduations and all the other events we\u2019re invited to for support of family and friends. I usually spend most of the time reading, working out and working at my job.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I watch my daughter dress up in costumes, and go to pub runs and concerts, and all the things that her age group does. What does our age group do? I don\u2019t want to dress up in costumes and go pub running by any means, but it would be fun to do things spontaneously and out of the ordinary instead of the same old things day in and day out. Maybe that\u2019s another secret to getting older, spontaneity? Have we lost it? Are we and our lives too predictable?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You have to admit, as we get older, we tend to get a little more rigid and structured. When was the last time you just up and went somewhere without a plan or, better yet, forgot everything you needed if you did.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we were younger, if we forgot something, we would just buy it, borrow it or live without it. We didn\u2019t fret about it; we just had fun because having fun was the main goal. As we get older, unfortunately we create agendas and fun becomes second on the list. We care more about the plan, the map, getting there and arranging what we will do when we are there, and then we lose the ability to be curious and open to new things as we did when we were kids. Remember how fun it was to be a kid and explore?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can\u2019t help but wonder if the actions I am taking today are preparing me for the ultimate slow down as I age. \u00a0I guess you could say I feel as though I am winding down. This is good in itself, but a little sad, as I comprehend slowing down as my mind and body age.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I understand to slow down is to enjoy life, but I liked being busy and feeling like I was achieving something in my younger days, even if it was only because I wasn\u2019t still.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I book a spa day once a month, and look forward (as would all women) to just devoting that day to myself. If we don\u2019t take care of ourselves, who will? If you can, devote one day a week or a month to yourself, and do what you can for yourself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will be much happier knowing that you are your own best friend, and don\u2019t feel guilty, because you deserve it. I love doing this alone as much, or more than, spending it with my partner or a good friend.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am able to center and reconnect with myself. The same self that sometimes is a little too hard on herself at times. I take this time to give myself permission to be okay with where I am in life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s my let-go time. Deepak Chopra says that happy cells create a happier and prettier person. I don\u2019t know about you, but I am happy to make myself happy. If making ourselves happy helps with looking good, even better.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don\u2019t like bad news and I certainly don\u2019t like to dwell on the negative. I think as middle-aged women, we have a lot of hope and should hold out for a happier future. We don\u2019t have to sit around and wait for an invitation or, worse, do something we are not enthusiastic about, simply because we don\u2019t have another option.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gone are the days when we were younger, and thought we had to please everyone by saying yes to the no things! At our age, we have a voice and an opinion and we are not afraid to let it be known.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I got tired of dreading Sundays because Monday was just around the corner, and knowing another week was about to begin, only for it to lead into yet another week and month, all the while doing the same things day in and day out. My life was becoming too predictable. Time passes very quickly when you don\u2019t live.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we let life live us instead of us living it, we only move from day to day, going through the motions and, pretty soon, we say, \u201cWhere did all the years go?\u201d We are not living in this mode. Our spirit gets bored and, even if we desire more, we just keep living this way because it\u2019s a habit. So, what is a middle-aged woman to do socially these days?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I felt this way, and I decided to take action and make a change in my life. And here\u2019s what I did. Have you ever heard of a website called meetup.com? Well if not, you should go there immediately. You can join groups of people who have interests similar to yours, and as many as you like.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just don\u2019t do what I did and join ten at one time, because it\u2019s hard to keep up with them. Join one or two and GO TO THE EVENTS! Don\u2019t just join because they look fun, actually go to the events and enjoy it. If you love wine (which most women our age do, hum, hum), then you can join a wine tasting group and meet like-minded people.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I like cooking, wine, running, writing and a lot of other things, so I joined these groups. Fun! You can also join them with your partner and enjoy good times together or just join them by yourself for some alone time. Now, if they only had a spa group!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Do these 5 things daily and reduce your age by 10 years:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=97003\" width=\"102\" height=\"102\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\/\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span><span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">fun<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy at middle-age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">meet up<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">things to do at middle-age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">travel<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">women<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/1013183_10151839239254073_2118116681_n11-400x280.jpg"},{"id":166,"slug":"are-we-happy-at-middle-age","type":"post","title":"ARE WE HAPPY AT MIDDLE AGE?","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\">ARE WE HAPPY AT MIDDLE AGE?<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Older women are the most dangerous on the planet. We have nothing to lose!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">~Jane Fonda<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Are we happy in the circumstances we are in, or have we settled as we have gotten older? Let\u2019s face it; aging requires change. We can\u2019t wear those sexy clothes we once wore, or wear the same makeup as when we were sixteen because that would be ridiculous.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To some, this may seem sad, even like a death sentence, to be forced to make changes that we don\u2019t want to. Unfortunately, and fortunately, we have to make sure we make changes as we age.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many women don\u2019t change, and they continue to do the same things they always did. Big mistake because you are not the same person you were when you were twenty, thirty, or even five years ago.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Life is moving faster, even when we feel we are slowing down. Look at it like this, you were a teen once and you wore stuff you wouldn\u2019t dream of wearing now. You naturally changed as you went into your twe<a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5thingstostayyoung\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5thingstostayyoung<\/a>nties. Somewhere along the way, we stopped and got stuck.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We continue to wear the same things and styles, year after year, decade after decade, without noticing that we need an update or, we do notice, but we doing nothing about it. Maybe it\u2019s because we get caught in a time gap. Are we still young, middle age, old or what?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do we perceive ourselves at middle age? At what point or decade do we make the necessary changes that should be made for our forever changing self?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The short answer is to look back at pictures, and if you have looked the same for the last ten, fifteen, twenty years or longer, you need a serious update. Don\u2019t panic, because it\u2019s not hard to do. A little change in your hair style, color, makeup and clothes, and you are all set.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I look at magazines for women my age, and I find inspiration through catalogs that cater to women over forty. It has served me well. In fact, I change a little too much. I change my hair color at least every six months. It\u2019s probably not the best thing to change so often.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My son was horrified when he knocked on my bedroom door one day to ask me a question, and when I opened the door to answer him, he looked shocked and yelled out, \u201cMom, your hair is blue!\u201d That statement didn\u2019t even faze my daughter, who was sitting at the kitchen table.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She didn\u2019t even bother to look my way because she knows me so well, and this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that I shock someone with the things I do to myself. It\u2019s just who I am and I happen to like it. By the way, the blue color was accidental. You see I had blonde hair, and one afternoon I decided I might look better with black hair. It was a funny mistake because the tint in the black dye turned my blonde hair blue (sounds like a country song doesn\u2019t it?).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I didn\u2019t panic; did I mention it\u2019s not my first time? My son, the tattletale that he is, couldn\u2019t wait to call his dad to inform him that his wife has blue hair. My husband, being a person that doesn\u2019t like change, and who had the lucky draw to be married to a person who does, was yet again, baffled by why I just couldn\u2019t be like everyone else and be, in his words, \u201cnormal.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He does admit though, I keep him on his toes because he never knows who he will come home to.

Let\u2019s admit it, doors open up for us when we are young. When we\u2019re old, we don\u2019t get the respect we deserve. As much I hated to admit it, it wasn\u2019t the aging that I was running from, it was the fear of the unknown that I could not come to terms with. This is the real obstacle in my aging progression.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I used to be afraid of cancer or a disease that I would die from. Now, after seeing my mother-in-law go from a Friday evening dinner as a relatively healthy and strong women to unable to wake up from a stroke on a Saturday morning, to a nursing home where she could not even feed herself, all within a week or so, made me realize two things:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One, that life is really short so quit living in fear and just start living in the moment, and two, that a nursing home is no place to live. So while we are capable we must use every moment to live and use our bodies.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">God sure does show up to teach us just at the right moment; when we are questioning our own existence. In Buddhism they say, \u201cWhen the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\u201d It\u2019s a sad reminder, and the reality of where we all end up.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019m not saying anything negative about reputable nursing homes, God bless them, but we all know how depressing they can be.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I walk in the nursing home I am completely in the moment, deeply grateful and extremely aware of every fiber of my being. I want to run out of there and scream at the top of my lungs about how grateful I am to be healthy, alive, and for the opportunity to walk out of there and be me, the person I have taken for granted lately.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have the opportunity and the great fortune to leave, and they never will. I feel that I\u2019ve won the lottery of life and they have lost. How beautiful is it to have everything, and to be awakened to appreciate it?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I walk through the halls to my mother-in-law\u2019s room, I mourn for the people lined up against the walls, left in their wheelchairs to deteriorate until their final day arrives. Seeing it in their eyes as I walk by, while trying not to look into their eyes, I see many wish that that final day will come sooner than later.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I tell myself it\u2019s not fair to get to an age and then be tossed aside. But I know it\u2019s in God\u2019s hands, and I only hope he is taking care of them in his own way,, and I hope they are feeling that he is too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I see people who were once happy and vibrant, and had the world in front of them as I do now. I realize how close I am to where I will be, and I am stricken with the reality that I better start living with gratitude and appreciation this minute, and not live in a future that may or may not come.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right now, today is all I have. I need to stop wasting my life fearing my future. I know that one day, I will look back at pictures of my middle-aged self I am so afraid of, and say, \u201cLook how young you really were.\u201d<\/p>\r\nIf you would like to get my PDF on how to age better click the link below:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=92813\" width=\"131\" height=\"131\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\/\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!

when she said, every since he turned fifty-five, he's been a different person.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I let her talk and I felt sad for her because I know that sometimes others want to put the burden of their unhappiness on another person and if that person will take the blame, they will pay a pretty heavy price for someone else's unhappiness.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also know that if we let others put their unhappiness on us then we should be responsible enough into making them accountable even if that means they are not happy with you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's face it. \u00a0People grow apart, people are not the same as they were when they first got married, etc. \u00a0Sometimes people get lost and they need to find their balance and when they can't a lot of people tend to look at the person by their side and blame them for being unhappy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe it's just coincidental that this usually happens for men and women around middle age and we blame it on menopause and hormone inbalance or whatever. \u00a0But true to the fact that it happens a lot.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While I've digressed a bit, I will get back to my point of this blog post and that is, not only women go through menopause. \u00a0Sure we get the bad wrap and we are held to a different standard then men, men also go through \"male menopause\" too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although a woman at middle age doesn't need me to go into depth about the symptoms of menopause, however, I am fairly sure that most women don't know the symptoms of male menopause.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here is a short overview on male menopause:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At midlife, just like women, men's hormones begin to decline. \u00a0 The symptoms manifest themselves with sleep problems, fatigue, less muscle strength, weight gain around the mid section, joint issues, depression, mood problems, panic attacks and a host of other symptoms.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is also called andropause and is usually noticed when a man is in his fifties. \u00a0Men, just like women, can offset the symptoms by getting their hormones balanced and, seeing a therapist if needed.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So if your husband or partner of many years all of a sudden becomes angry at you for being the person that you are, one, don't change who you are for anyone and consider talking to them about seeing a physician to get their hormone levels checked and two, don't blame yourself. \u00a0This only creates damage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, sometimes people are not happy and it's because they are simply not happy and they don't see they have an issue therefore, everyone around them becomes miserable.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is each person job not anyone else's job to make themselves happy. \u00a0When they can't and they won't and it starts to become your problem, sometimes a life worth living is not that life anymore.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before

AND HORMONE DISRUPTION","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">CHEMICALS AND HORMONE DISRUPTION<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will start with pesticides and how they affect our hormones.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of the most widely used pesticides are known to copy estrogenic hormones.\u00a0 This is because they firmly bind to hormone receptor sites in the body.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Strange things are happening to our bodies, moreover to our youth.\u00a0 Although some may deny that there is a connection between pesticides and hormone related issues, however, the fact is, even in minute doses, they can cause abnormal functions of our immune system, reproductive system, and central nervous system.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example PCB\u2019s are in the environment and can act like thyroid hormone.\u00a0 I myself was recently diagnosed with thyroid disease and so was my mother, sister in law, friends and some co-workers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have often wondered if there is something causing this other than our own natural deterioration.\u00a0 When most everyone you know is on the same medication with the same diagnoses, I believe something is happening and, some questions should be answered.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then there is Dioxin in bleached products we consume which depletes sperm production and does other harmful things.\u00a0 Nonylphenols that are added to plastic also mimics estrogen.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can keep going and add to the list but you get the picture.\u00a0I am not writing this to create fear, nor do I want you to live in a bubble, that\u2019s not the point.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I do want to convey is for you to understand that certain chemicals and pesticides disrupt the endocrine system.\u00a0 This is the system that balances out our hormones.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you

ACTIVITY AND AGING","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\">PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND AGING<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Engaging in physical activity does the body wonders.\u00a0 In fact when we exercise, every cell in our body benefits from it. \u00a0Working out lowers our blood pressure and makes our arteries stronger.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It also makes our bones stronger, our brains better and, helps our immune system, not to mention it helps maintain our weight goals as well.\u00a0 I workout daily although my motto is \u201cthe best part of working out is when it\u2019s done\u201d it does feel good to have done it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is basically three types of exercising and these are cardio, strength training and, yoga\/stretching.\u00a0 Of course there are different types of programs such as, plyometrics, circuit training, high intensity interval training, tabata, crossfit, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These all have value but cardio is the best overall.\u00a0 Of course you get some cardio from weight training from strength training, it is better to get your heart rate to seventy-five and eighty-five percent of its maximum capacity for at least 20 minutes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This translates into about 120 beats a minute for the average person.\u00a0 If you like riding bikes, dancing or fast walking, these can also be beneficial as well.\u00a0 Of course cardio will burn lots of calories fast.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lifting weights creates lean muscle mass.\u00a0 The more muscle mass we have the more growth hormone and other anti-aging combinations we will have.\u00a0 Not to mention we will look lean and toned which looks asthically pleasing to say the least.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yoga and stretching improves mobility and flexibility as we age.\u00a0 It also helps improve strength and we need all of these as we age to prevent injury.\u00a0 Endorsing both the renewal process and the exercise process, you will endorse a better body both inside and out.\u00a0 You will also add years to your life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course exercising takes effort.\u00a0 A lot of people don\u2019t like to exercise or say they just don\u2019t have the time.\u00a0 If you absolutely hate to exercis--ee, I say do the easiest one that way you will do it.\u00a0 Anything is better than nothing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who knows, after while, you may do more and more as you look and feel better.\u00a0 If you say you don\u2019t have time then get up earlier or split your workout into two sessions.\u00a0 Do twenty minutes before your morning shower and twenty quickly before you eat dinner.\u00a0 You will be amazed how well this works and how fast it goes by breaking it up.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you think you will fail to eat right, workout and, renew your body because maybe, you have failed many times before, you shouldn't. \u00a0Living in the renewal process is simply the way our bodies want us to in order to optimize its longevity.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You don\u2019t have to do it in one big leap, just take your time.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier to take one day at a time and do your best. \u00a0Go easy at first and then the harder stuff will come easier too.<\/p>\r\n<p

radical exposure","content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you read this blog then you know that I have been writing a lot lately about free radicals and how they can damage our cells and, how they fast forward the aging process. \u00a0They also fast forward disease and unfortunately, death.\r\n\r\nMother Nature has provided us with all the necessary ingredients to fight free radicals such essential nutrients and plant based foods.\r\n\r\nWithout getting too rigid or making a rapid life change, here are things you can do to reduce your exposure to free radical damage:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Eat organic, pesticide free foods.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Don\u2019t eat foods or drink anything with dye or additives.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Drink only filtered and purified water.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Avoid exposure to chemicals (this means perfume and hairspray too).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Avoid exposure to pollution. Stay off busy streets when running\/exercising.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Only get any type of X-ray when absolutely needed.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Only take medicines when absolutely needed.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s normal for our bodies to generate free radicals.\u00a0 They are a by-product of our bodies metabolic functions like when cells use oxygen to transfer food into energy.\u00a0 Our bodies expect this kind of thing so it is armed and ready to to naturally grab these suckers before they can harm us.\r\n\r\nWhat our bodies can't handle is an overload!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you would like to get my PDF on how to get started here is the link below<\/strong>:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=3394\" width=\"148\" height=\"148\" \/><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\"><strong>https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes-\/<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!

You have major cellular damage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If this happens your cells won\u2019t be able to reproduce which in turn ages you and causes death.\u00a0 The best way to avoid this is to be in the protection mode by supplementing our diets.\u00a0 Antioxidants are like worker ants for our bodies.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We need essential nutrients and we need phytochemicals.\u00a0 Essential nutrients are what we absolutely have to have to wake up and stay alive.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are: A, C and E (antioxidants), antioxidant minerals such as copper, selenium and zinc.\u00a0 These minerals scavenge free radicals.\u00a0 Next is, essential fatty acids and amino acids.\u00a0 These do double duty by being an antioxidant and strengthening our membranes so we can fight viruses.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They are not made by our bodies so we have to get them from our diets.\u00a0 Unlike essential nutrients, phytochemicals are not required for survival.\u00a0 However, the nutrients that we get from plants are essential in order to protect ourselves from a degenerative disease.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have cells like T lymphocytes and macrophages that digest free radicals.\u00a0 They get rid of viruses, bacteria, allergens, and pollution.\u00a0 They do this before trouble begins.\u00a0 Thus, we have the protection mode.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next is the repair defense mode. From fixing minor dings to replacing entire cells, the repair must occur rapidly and efficiently.\u00a0 The slower the rate of repair the faster we age and die.\u00a0 The rate of repair must be the same as the rate of damage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is an exception to repair and it\u2019s our DNA.\u00a0 When we damage our DNA, it\u2019s a direct damage to our genetic code and, without this being intact, a cell can\u2019t do its job to repair or replicate itself.\u00a0 When this happens, the message to our body becomes scrambled.\u00a0 A failure like this translates to aging and death.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regeneration is when a cell dies and our body replaces the cell with an exact replica. Renewal is our bodies healing system.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'll be sharing more about the renewal process in upcoming posts!<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you would like to get my PDF on how to get started here is the link below:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=3394\" width=\"135\" height=\"135\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes-\/<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging and Health<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">antioxidants<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">cancer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">DNA damage<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">dying<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">free radical damage<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to live longer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">living longer<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">supplementing your diet<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">supplements<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the bodies renewal process<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/20959515_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":117,"slug":"117","type":"post","title":"ANTI-AGING WAY TO EAT","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">THE ANTI-AGING WAY TO EAT<\/span><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is not a diet blog or a blog that will give you specific meal plans.\u00a0 However, once you understand that you must consume antioxidants and adequate supplies of nutrients, you will have the knowledge to create meals that include the essentials required to renew your cells.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are about six nutrients that will accommodate the renewal process.\u00a0 If anyone one these are lacking then the renewal process will slow down conversely, if all of them are highly functioning, the process will speed up with the goal of a healthy and disease free body. These nutrients are:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Amino Acids<\/u><\/strong> which are enzymes and enzymes are proteins.\u00a0 These proteins are building blocks.\u00a0 It is best to get these by consuming whole grains and beans rather than by consuming meats.\u00a0 Meat and other animal based products are acidic and they cause free radicals in the body, whereas whole grains and beans do not.\u00a0 Plant based foods are neutralizers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Complex Carbohydrates <\/u><\/strong>provide energy to our cells.\u00a0 Again, unrefined, whole grains and beans offer the best quality.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be fooled by natural sugars because they undermine the cells ability to regenerate by fueling your body with junk instead of clean fuel.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Essential Fatty Acids<\/u><\/strong> are the fat vitamins that serve as building blocks for our cells membranes.\u00a0 They are free radical killers and they enhance our body\u2019s immune system.\u00a0 Essential fatty acids are used by the body as an anti-inflammatory protector.\u00a0 Foods like seeds, beans and vegetables have minimal amounts of essential fatty acids however, for the optimal amount needed; we can supplement our diet with flax seed and borage oil.\u00a0 Fish oil is another good source.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Vitamins and Minerals <\/u><\/strong>are needed to help with the chemical process of our bodies.\u00a0 For example when we talk about antioxidants which are the scavengers that eat free radicals, we are relating to vitamins such as A, C and E.\u00a0 With regard to minerals, these are cofactors that help our enzyme systems, thus helping our enzymes perform the tasks necessary to renew our cells.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Phytochemicals <\/u><\/strong>These are the difference between basic nutrition and super nutrition. They are key factors in preventing heart disease and cancer.\u00a0 Phytochemicals are only found in plant foods.\u00a0 The brighter the food colors the better.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are approximately 100 trillion cells that make up the human body.\u00a0 The body needs food to generate energy.\u00a0 Our cells try to stay healthy.\u00a0 When we don\u2019t take care of them, we are fighting against their natural ability to heal themselves.\u00a0 They greatly need our help in the process.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every cell in the body is dependent upon key nutrients.\u00a0 When we don\u2019t feed our body with the right nutrients and, when key nutrients are not available, a cell may become compromised.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With today\u2019s American diet, we may be losing the battle to create cell renewal by eating processed foods, pesticides, foods whose vitamins have been depleted, saturated fats and sugar.\u00a0 These foods create free radicals and little nutrition to our cells.\u00a0 Foods like meat, dairy products, \u00a0fried foods and, fast foods, taste good and, they satisfy but, they shorten our life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To counter the effects of the American diet and, to provide us with the necessary nutrients to our cells, it is advisable to eat a low-fat and vegetarian diet and, supplement with vitamins and minerals.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our cells are where everything that goes into our mouth ends up and, they have a purpose even if we are not mindful at the time we are shoving a donut down the hatch.\u00a0 If our cells could talk, they would not allow us to eat unhealthy, but instead, guide us as we eat, in the right direction to optimize our cells.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Until they can talk, it is up to us to improve our diets therefore, improving our life span.\u00a0 We may be able to live to 100 and beyond without degenerative disease if we make an effort to.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">diet<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">free radical damage<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to anti age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to eat better<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">supplements<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the anti aging way to eat<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/33766058_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":111,"slug":"a-new-way-to-age","type":"post","title":"A new way to age","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A NEW WAY TO AGE<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Renewing yourself is your body\u2019s master plan for rejuvenation.\u00a0 <em><strong>This consists of three important steps; protect, repair and rejuvenate.<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 Our body\u2019s renewal system prevents disease by protecting the cells and then repairing the damaged ones.\u00a0 We are given a specific healing system and its mission is to achieve maximum health.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why do we need an elaborate healing system to renew ourselves?\u00a0 Because the damage that we do to ourselves and for what our environment does to us, threatens our entire existence.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Renewal is a constant process in our body.\u00a0 Just trying to repair the everyday wear and tear is bad enough but then, the renewal process must kick it up a notch should we get sick or injured.\u00a0 \u00a0When we have an acute or chronic condition, our body kicks into overdrive to repair the damage that has been done.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A good example of how the body can renew itself better is, if you break a bone, or cut yourself or, sustain an injury of some kind.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t have your renewal system revved up then it may take you a bit of time to heal.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, if your cells are in renewal mode then you will heal much faster.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to extend our life span, we must halt cellular damage and increase our healing system.\u00a0 To do this we come back to, protecting, repairing and regenerating our cells.\u00a0 Each one of these should function to its optimal level and if they don\u2019t then, the entire system will fail.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We already know the key to cell renewal is antioxidants because our cells are under constant attack from free radicals.\u00a0 The damage free radicals do to cells shortens our life which means that we die before we need to due to cellular damage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cA typical cell is hit by approximately twenty billion free radicals per day.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 So long as we have enough free radicals in our body, we can fight this.\u00a0 Think about it, twenty billion free radicals hit just one cell! And, we have so many cells.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you get down to it, why wouldn\u2019t we help our body fight against this mass attack by consuming antioxidants and avoiding the things that cause free radicals in the first place?\u00a0 See when we let our antioxidants fall below optimal then free radicals have the upper hand.\u00a0 After a billion hits here and there, now you have serious cellular damage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This type of damage not only causes disease but it\u2019s the quickest way to aging.\u00a0 Again, how to counter this is to take in generous amounts of antioxidant foods and supplements.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you would like to get my PDF on how to get started here is the link below:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=49460\" width=\"147\" height=\"147\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes-\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!

we feel more tired and, absolutely have to take care of our bodies just to feel good each day.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because we turn 50, it doesn\u2019t mean its all downhill for us.\u00a0 \u00a0Sure, when we were young we had a free ride and now, the free ride is over.\u00a0 We shouldn\u2019t panic.\u00a0 Maybe we watched our parent\u2019s age and it wasn\u2019t so great.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, we expected we would age like them and felt we had no control in the aging process.\u00a0 We see wrinkles and gray hair and, begin to believe we are destined to age and, there is nothing we can do about it.\u00a0 We think \u201cit\u2019s just a matter of time\u201d before our number is up.\u00a0 But, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u00a0 With a little modification, we can live a long and healthy life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we put effort into renewing our bodies, the old philosophies are shattered and, so are the popular myths about aging.\u00a0 We are older and wiser now and, we have the key to good health through the renewal process.\u00a0 Whether you received a key is up to you to decide if you want to open the door to great health and vitality.\u00a0 It requires a bit of effort, discipline and a few lifestyle changes but its not anything we can\u2019t have if we want it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rewards can be tremendous.\u00a0 If you consider the alternative to renewal, it\u2019s only a matter of time before disease will set in and your number will be up in one way or another. \u00a0We may still live long but the quality will be far different than had we taken the necessary steps to renew our bodies.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we don\u2019t eat right or we don\u2019t exercise and, we endure emotional stress, it causes our bodies to wear out before their time.\u00a0 For some, years or decades before they should have to.\u00a0 We have all seen that 40 year old who looks 60 and vice versa.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Believe me, it\u2019s more than just genetics.\u00a0 By undermining the renewal process you deny yourself the support your body requires to renew its systems.\u00a0 If we do our job and take care of our body, our body will do its job and take care of us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our body will remain strong for a very long time and we will benefit at any age.\u00a0 It\u2019s important not to accept a decline in our body\u2019s ability to be healthy.\u00a0 Contrary to what we are told, it\u2019s not a natural decline.\u00a0 It\u2019s only natural if we abuse our body and not replenish it properly and, the sooner you begin, the better life you will have.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are never too old to start taking care of yourself.\u00a0 Even if you are very old, don\u2019t tell yourself \u201cwhy bother now.\u201d Now is as good a time as any.\u00a0 So you may be in your seventies, eighties or even nineties and think there is not enough time to make a difference.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me tell you that you can add good quality years to your life.\u00a0 While you are living and breathing you\u00a0 can still enjoy what life and the world has to offer.\u00a0 Yes we will all die but why not live well and be healthy and happy while you are still here.\u00a0 Why rush it?\u00a0 Why not make just a few changes or makes some modifications slowly to have a better quality of life?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you would like to get my PDF on how to get started here is the link below:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=78613\" width=\"106\" height=\"106\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes-\/<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

If we do this, then they say, we can be happy so, this is what most of us do whether we have found the right partner or not.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether we had two parents or a single parent who drilled this message into us, one way or another, most of us are taught this way of thinking.\u00a0 We may get this message from the media, the movies, our teachers, friends, or our family.\u00a0 The dream we learn is to get married, have a family and live happily ever after. It is our nature to be paired with another.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those fantasies, the same ones that make us expect our husbands, boyfriends, girlfriends, to know what is always on our mind so that they will remember that special holiday without us reminding them or better yet, without them waiting until ten minutes before they come home to grab some cheap flowers that say \u201cYou are not that special, but I didn\u2019t want to hear you complain so I grabbed these at the grocery store along with the toilet paper.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know, the images we have in our head, the one that stops us when we see a commercial and in 30 seconds condition us to believe that love is all that matters and the perfect mate is all you need to be happy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If only we could have the perfect one? Oh, and last but not least, the fantasy about us being completed by someone else. \u00a0Completed by someone else? Can you imagine that?\u00a0 As if that\u2019s possible?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am starting to sound like a sad country song I know.\u00a0 I can already see the lyrics, girl finds perfect guy, they have the perfect wedding, careers, kids and then boom! He never comes home, she drinks too much wine and, the kids are all messed up!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By generating illusions about finding the perfect partner, we are setting ourselves up for failure.\u00a0 Even our parents probably didn\u2019t have such great marriages.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Fairy tale of perfection doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 Will we be or, are we lucky enough to find the perfect person to share the rest of our lives with?\u00a0 The vital point is that there is no other perfect person for anyone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That\u2019s why so many people can\u2019t find that special person because the perfect person is a delusion propagated by things outside of ourselves. \u00a0We may have painted a pretty picture in our minds of the perfect love but really, you are your own perfect person.\u00a0 What we need to focus on, if we want a long lasting relationship of any kind is, <em>compatibility<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, at first you may have some chemistry or the relationship is new so you live in the moment.\u00a0 Once it begins to become comfortable, you begin to see how compatible or incompatible you are.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this point, you have invested some time so rather than throw the relationship away if you are not compatible, you begin to overlook the many ways that you are not compatible with your partner.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fairy tales can still exist for some but, for the most part, life is not about idealism, its about real life stuff and sometimes its difficult and sometimes its not so perfect.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">breakups<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">divorce<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">high standards<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to be happy<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to find the perfect boyfriend<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">love<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">marriage<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">perfection<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">reality<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">relationships<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">the perfect partner<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/relationship.jpg"},{"id":81,"slug":"coping-with-social-anxiety","type":"post","title":"Coping with Social Anxiety","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coping with Social Anxiety<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAbout 3.7% of the U.S. population -- approximately 5.3 million Americans -- is affected by social phobia.\u201d\u00a0 This is the same as Social Anxiety (SA).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cSocial phobia, also called Social Anxiety Disorder, is an anxiety disorder characterized by overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations.

Keep your eyes closed and enjoy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some say by doing this, we can avoid the onset of a cold, etc. \u00a0If at the very least, we relax and feel comfort by doing this.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Floral waters<\/em><\/strong> are made by using about ten drops of essential oil added to a sprayer with the purest water you can find. \u00a0Four ounces of water to a mixture of whatever oils that you like. \u00a0You can spray it on your skin to refresh and relax or, spray it into the air too.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Bathing with essential<\/strong><\/em> oils can stimulate your skin, induce relaxation, and provide energy to your body. \u00a0The heat of the water helps to penetrate your skin thus, enhances circulation. \u00a0Rosemary can actually help stimulate the release of toxins.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use essential oils in foot baths and add them to your lotion for a soothing and invigorating feel.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Massage oil<\/strong><\/em> (my favorite), works oils into the skin.

Be happy!","content":"&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There\u2019s no cure for growing old, but it\u2019s our attitude that changes everything.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">~Huffington Post<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to write this, because I tend to generalize, and what I worry about may not be what others worry about. Let me start by saying, I try not to worry at all because, one, worrying causes wrinkles, and two, worrying gets you nowhere.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">'As Dr. Phil says, \u201cWorrying is like chewing gum in a rocking chair trying to solve an algebra problem.\u201d It is just a waste of time and doesn\u2019t get us anywhere. If we are not careful, worrying can turn into a hobby or, worse, an addiction.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0I know this because my mother worries even when she doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about. She has done this for almost seventy years, so why stop now? She doesn\u2019t know any other way to live and, unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have the will or the desire to change. She is comfortable in her worries. It\u2019s become her friend.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I decided I wouldn\u2019t be like my mother and, every time I thought about something that might cause me to worry, I would replace the fear with a positive thought. Eventually, I broke the habit that I had learned growing up.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It helps me to have a partner who is the complete opposite. He doesn\u2019t allow me to think about the things I cannot change. He doesn\u2019t want to hear it. He says worrying is making excuses.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There was a time I\u2019d get really mad at him because he never wanted to hear me go on and on with my latest worry or story I had to tell. I mean, I wanted to complain and make assumptions about the world, and he wanted no part of it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Worrying about things that we cannot change comes from the fear of what we cannot control. Once we understand that we can\u2019t control anything, and we let it pass through us, we can break this cycle. When I can\u2019t let something pass through me because I am so fixated on it, and nothing I do allows it to pass through me, I decide to step back and, like a bullet, let it fly in front of me and dodge it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes it\u2019s hard to get something out of our minds that we remain anxious about, so it then becomes comfortable. Don\u2019t get comfortable in worrying. Don\u2019t look for or allow things to occupy your mind 24\/7.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are all going to die and everything else in between doesn\u2019t really matter. Worrying is just stories we keep telling ourselves over and over. Don\u2019t talk to your mind when it\u2019s like this, it\u2019s just trying to keep itself busy by occupying your spirit. Trust me, you have better things to do with your time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we put the burden of worrying aside, and go about doing the stuff we are meant to do, just think how much we can accomplish in our lives. So much time is wasted on worrying.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are a woman who worries, it\u2019s wise to stop the cycle, because worry turns into anxiety and then your life gets out of control. Right now, we have to be in control. There will always be things we can\u2019t control, and we simply have to accept them and move on. If something catastrophic does happen, just wait it out, it too shall pass.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Truth be told, as we age, a lot will begin to go wrong all around us. There will always be another problem, crisis or issue. And it\u2019s how we respond those problems and issues that will free us from worry. Don\u2019t look for or wait for things to happen. Bad things will happen and, we create what we fear.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There will be deaths, divorce, sickness and other terrible events, so accept them and deal with them as best you can and then move on. We can\u2019t change or stop what is meant to be. We can\u2019t blame ourselves for circumstances that happen, either.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women tend to blame themselves for bad things that happen, either to them or to those they love. I know I blamed myself when my kids weren\u2019t happy, when my brother died, and when my beloved dog died. I thought if I could have been a better mother, sister and dog owner, things would have been better.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I realize now that my kids and other people choose their own happiness. Disease will overtake people and dogs, and they will die, just like I am meant to. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, just God\u2019s will. Don\u2019t think you can change destiny. You are not God, so don\u2019t try to take on the role and just be you, the one and only, unique you and don't worry.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">death<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">depression<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">disease<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">divorce<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">getting older<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">grief<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to stop anxiety<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to stop worrying<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 70<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">social anxiety<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">women and worry<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">worry<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/35345422_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":60,"slug":"men-dont-understand-us-but-carbs-do","type":"post","title":"MEN DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND US, BUT CARBS DO!","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">MEN DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND US, BUT CARBS DO!<\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I walked into my anti-aging OBGYN\u2019s office and there on the wall was a large poster that read, No carbs after 40! Wow, I thought. This is so true, but so wrong at the same time. I love carbs, I absolutely do. I love to bite into creamy garlic mashed potatoes and feel my problems melt away. I love to eat rice and pasta so much that . . . Heck, I can\u2019t, and don\u2019t, want to live without carbs, ever! I tried it once for about a week and, I swear, I had a mental breakdown!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I actually lost it on the fifth day, and then checked myself into a Holiday Inn just so I could get away from my family. I needed space. I needed my fix. My body and my mind were so carb-deprived that I actually thought I was losing it. A little dramatic, probably, but wouldn\u2019t you know, just as soon as I got back to those lovely potatoes, I was the good ole me again, happy and a little round.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Stressed-woman-300x237.jpg\" \/>Remember when you were younger and you could eat anything you wanted and never gain weight? I never thought twice about what food groups I could or couldn\u2019t eat. The more ketchup on the French fries the better. Now, I eat carbs and I blow up. I mean it; I can go a few days on veggies and fish and loose a few pounds, however, just as soon as I put pasta in my mouth, bam!! I have gained weight. It may not be right, but it tastes so good, and it feels so right while I\u2019m eating them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carbs know just the right way to make me happy. I long for the days when I could eat whatever the heck I wanted and never think twice about it, let alone feel guilty for doing so. I am so aware of the guilt when I\u2019m eating carbs that I don\u2019t taste them or enjoy them like I should or like I used to. It\u2019s like I just put them in my mouth, then hurry up and swallow, because I feel so bad for eating them. It\u2019s just wrong how we are punished for eating carbs by our scales and the clothing designers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have been conditioned by my doctor, the media, and magazines, and I have put conditions on myself to feel bad if I enjoy a plate of macaroni and cheese. When I complain that my muffin top looks horrible, and when I\u2019m reminded of the movie stars who\u2019ve had a baby and, within one week, were half the size they were before they got pregnant because they stopped eating carbs and ate only chicken, my mind tells me to just shut up and enjoy my life!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our culture (for the moment, at least) looks down on women who eat carbs. As women, we are totally blamed for every pound we gain. I watched one of those housewives shows the other day and one housewife was having a dinner party for another housewife, and she told her chef the only condition she had with the menu was that there were to be no carbs at dinner! So they stay skinny, but they seem so miserable. Really, the only condition is not having even one carb on the menu?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know it\u2019s better for me to reduce carbs, yet, I still long for them. \u00a0I mean, if I am going to eat them, and get that insulin spike that goes along with them, the one that goes straight from my lips to my hips, I better damn well enjoy them. I better savor every bite of those garlic mash potatoes, that pasta and that wonderful, warm bread with olive oil, if I may say so myself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know full well that a good bowl of macaroni and cheese, though it may create the most pleasurable experience on my tongue and in my brain, will cause me emotional pain when trying to fit into my jeans or while standing in a dressing room of the department store wondering why I look so lumpy and why my stubborn belly hangs over my belt.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We know at our age, carbs are the villains that keep the weight on us, yet, we still crave and eat them. Honestly, unless you are craving a big boring salad, there is nothing better than the waiter delivering that wonderful pasta dish with a nice glass of wine. Your mood instantly changes when you see your food because, even if only temporarily, you will enjoy every bite you put into your mouth and, for a little while, you will be content.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Men and women are different because we each have different food preferences. Men love meat and women love carbs, it\u2019s just a fact. Why deny it or fight it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women apparently eat carbs at a much higher rate than men, and we get the wonderful middle age hips and belly to show for it. And you know, once you gain weight at middle age, it\u2019s almost impossible to get rid of it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oh, and did I mention a nice piece of chocolate cake? And who doesn\u2019t like some really good pizza with red wine? Some things in life are not only irreplaceable, but also should be a part of one\u2019s happiness, and this includes carbs. All of them! I say eat those lovely carbs, because carbs understand us even when men don\u2019t.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Happiness<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">bread<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">carbohydrates<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">carbs<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to eat what you want and not gain weight<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">middle age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">pasta<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">weight gain<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">wine<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">women<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/2766763_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":53,"slug":"how-to-change-your-look-as-you-age","type":"post","title":"How to change your look as you age","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to change your look as you age<\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love to change my makeup, but I am guilty of wearing the same pink lipstick. A habit my husband says he wishes I would change, because he hates lipstick, especially when he ends up wearing mine. I decided to go to a nude lipstick, and it seems to serve me better (okay, with the color hair I have this month).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don\u2019t change your appearance at least once a year, then you may be guilty of living in a comfort zone, and this is what I am talking about. Is it serving you well? Many times when we don\u2019t make necessary changes to our appearance for fear of looking older, we can look older by dating ourselves.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019m not talking about coloring your hair purple or pink (or blue for that matter), and wearing bright makeup with a mini skirt and stripper heels, gosh no! In fact, that will only make you look older, and let other people know there is something not natural about you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Look at celebrities our age; the underlying theme is neutral with a little splash of color. This could mean you have blonde hair and neutral makeup, with a cute, colorful outfit or some trendy shoes. Or, you could add a pop of shadow with a neutral outfit, and add some color with your bag and shoes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Updating your look shouldn\u2019t cause you stress, nor should it be expensive. It\u2019s a matter of keeping yourself modern. You update your phone, your computer, software, cars, etc. Don\u2019t make yourself less important than the things and events in your life. You are much more important than anything else.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surprise your partner; believe me, they will love the change even if they don\u2019t admit it. Don\u2019t be too predictable. Don\u2019t grow your hair long only to clip it on the top of your head every day. What\u2019s the point in that? Go for a style, instead of length. It will show off your best features.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And one last thing, clean out your closet! Believe me, if you haven\u2019t worn a piece of clothing in six months, you probably never will. Let go of the past and welcome a new a vibrant future.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of us don\u2019t realize that we are making mistakes with the way we wear our hair, makeup, and clothing. We can no longer shop the twenty dollar racks and pick out things that aren\u2019t flattering like we did when we were young.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah I know, we could make a sack look good back then, we could make anything work. Now it\u2019s an investment we must make in our appearance that makes the difference. Yes, it\u2019s an investment like your home and your car. Don\u2019t you think you should at least come in third to those things, if not first?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because we should dress age-appropriate doesn\u2019t mean we should dress in an unflattering way; very much the opposite. We can dress to complement our age and look great and even a bit edgy. The goal is to look as good as you can and be comfortable, but not try to re-create your twenties.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can never go back, so why stress trying to. Be the best for the age that you are now. It\u2019s very refreshing to see a woman own her age and still look great. It\u2019s a glow that comes from within, chose to shine. Many women are afraid to make changes because they feel they will look silly. This is not true. We look ridiculous when we look the same as we did when we were younger.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving yourself! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">anti-aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">change your look<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to change your look<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to look good for your age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">look younger<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">makeup<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 70<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/32444263_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":40,"slug":"breast-implant-disease","type":"post","title":"Breast implant disease","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Breast implant disease. \u00a0Have you ever heard of it? \u00a0I just read an interesting article in an alternative health book. \u00a0I thought is was worth sharing if you have breast implants or are thinking of getting them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The article says that regardless of the type of implant that a person has (saline, silicone, etc.) most women will probably develop health problems because the bodies white blood cells breakdown the implant coating.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The body literally chews off little pieces of the silicone casing and then carry the pieces into another area of tissue where where the white blood cells dies but, not before releasing foreign material in the tissue.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The point of the article is that ALL implants release foreign material no matter what type of implant there is and even, when they are not ruptured.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get this, Dr. W.

We have nothing to lose!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">~Jane Fonda<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are we happy in the circumstances we are in, or have we settled as we have gotten older? Let\u2019s face it; aging requires change. We can\u2019t wear those sexy clothes we once wore, or wear the same makeup as when we were sixteen because that would be ridiculous. To some, this may seem sad, even like a death sentence, to be forced to make changes that we don\u2019t want to. Unfortunately, and fortunately, we have to make sure we make changes as we age. Many women don\u2019t change, and they continue to do the same things they always did. Big mistake because you are not the same person you were when you were twenty, thirty, or even five years ago.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Life is moving faster, even when we feel we are slowing down. Look at it like this, you were a teen once and you wore stuff you wouldn\u2019t dream of wearing now. You naturally changed as you went into your twenties. Somewhere along the way, we stopped and got stuck. We continue to wear the same things and styles, year after year, decade after decade, without noticing that we need an update or, we do notice, but we doing nothing about it. Maybe it\u2019s because we get caught in a time gap. Are we still young, middle age, old or what? How do we perceive ourselves at middle age? At what point or decade do we make the necessary changes that should be made for our forever changing self?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The short answer is to look back at pictures, and if you have looked the same for the last ten, fifteen, twenty years or longer, you need a serious update. Don\u2019t panic, because it\u2019s not hard to do. A little change in your hair style, color, makeup and clothes, and you are all set. I look at magazines for women my age, and I find inspiration through catalogs that cater to women over forty. It has served me well. In fact, I change a little too much. I change my hair color at least every six months. It\u2019s probably not the best thing to change so often. My son was horrified when he knocked on my bedroom door the other day to ask me a question, and when I opened the door to answer him, he looked shocked and yelled out, \u201cMom, your hair is blue!\u201d That statement didn\u2019t even faze my daughter, who was sitting at the kitchen table. She didn\u2019t even bother to look my way because she knows me so well, and this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that I shock someone with the things I do to myself. It\u2019s just who I am and I happen to like it. By the way, the blue color was accidental. You see I had blonde hair, and one afternoon I decided I might look better with black hair.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was a funny mistake because the tint in the black dye turned my blonde hair blue (sounds like a country song doesn\u2019t it?). I didn\u2019t panic; did I mention it\u2019s not my first time? My son, the tattletale that he is, couldn\u2019t wait to call his dad to inform him that his wife has blue hair. My husband, being a person that doesn\u2019t like change, and who had the lucky draw to be married to a person who does, was yet again, baffled by why I just couldn\u2019t be like everyone else and be, in his words, \u201cnormal.\u201d He does admit though, I keep him on his toes because he never knows who he will come home to. I rest my case! Change is a good thing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Uncategorized<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">aging gracefully<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">anti-aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">changing your look<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to look as good as you feel<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to look good for your age<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">look great<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">wrinkles<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/30576356_s-400x280.jpg"},{"id":34,"slug":"the-fear-of-aging","type":"post","title":"The fear of aging","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fear of aging<\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How will I handle being old? All of my life, I felt good about myself and how I looked. I definitely wasn\u2019t a beautiful girl, but I think I got better looking as I got older. I know it\u2019s only a matter of time before I will look in the mirror and see my old self. Who knows, I may already be there. However, I know my reflection does not define who I am. I am coming to terms with my ever-changing self.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s scary getting older. Maybe it\u2019s not so much the superficial part of aging, but it\u2019s the fear of the unknown. My body is changing, my kids have moved on, my mother is elderly, and I wonder how much longer I will be here. Will I be stricken with an illness that I cannot overcome like I could when I was younger? I know we will all die but, how will I die, I wonder.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Will my partner leave me for a younger woman? Will age discrimination show its ugly face to me? And all the while as I enjoyed being young, I told myself I would never get old. I remember, when I was a kid, I literally thought I would never get old. So many things go through my head when I think about the journey of my aging self. I suppose I could take my ego out of the situation and just let the experience happen, because fear is only part of our ego. Why not just do it, I ask myself? Yet, there is nothing I can do to stop aging as we are all going to age, and no matter how much I kick and scream, I too will have to age; and all the makeup and the creams will not stop it, no matter how much I put on.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How many times have you seen older women who are stunningly beautiful for their age? Is the key phrase here \u201cfor their age?\u201d Why can\u2019t we just be absolutely beautiful no matter what age we are? We see movie stars like Jane Fonda, Raquel Welch, and Sofia Loren and think, \u201cWow, these women are absolutely stunning; I want to look like that when I get old.\u201d But there are two problems with this statement: The first is, they didn\u2019t age naturally, and they had a lot of help, and I mean a lot. There\u2019s nothing wrong with getting help, but where are all the real examples of beautifully aging women? There are some celebrities, like Diane Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer and several others, who are beginning to balk at the need to have cosmetic surgery, and it\u2019s refreshing to see what real aging should look like. It\u2019s a beautiful thing that they are willing to do this in today\u2019s culture. Sad to say though, as they get much older, they usually quietly cave-in to what society demands of women, and that is to remain youthful or just disappear.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>If you would like to know how you can really look ten years younger doing 5 things a day, download my PDF below:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/the-5-huge-mistakes-\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! \u00a0Click the link below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https:\/\/theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co\/rejuvenate-renew\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/i><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>","videolink":"","cat_names":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span>","cat_names_all":"<span class=\"category-span\">Aging<\/span>","tag_names":"<span class=\"tag-span\">aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">getting old<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">happiness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">health<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">how to make peace with aging<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">life<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">older<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 40<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 50<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">over 60<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">peace<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">sickness<\/span><span class=\"tag-span\">wrinkles<\/span>","fimg_url":"https:\/\/myagingandwellness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/invisible-400x280.jpg"},{"id":31,"slug":"is-it-worth-it-to-take-medication","type":"post","title":"Is it worth it to take medication?","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it worth it to take medication?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">About two years ago, my doctor put me on thyroid medication.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me start from a quick beginning with out boring you to death!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I go to an OBGYN who practices natural medication as much as possible. I started going to her because I was working out pretty hard with weights and not seeing any real results. Long story short, this was the beginning of all the damn medication I'm on now!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She did a blood test and said everything looked good but my Testosterone was low. This was why I wasn't seeing results. That was about six years ago. She put me on a bio-identical cream and off I went. I gained ten pounds and gained a little muscle.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At my next check up, my Progesterone was low so I got a compound prescription and off I went again. Now I was on Testosterone and Progesterone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two years later after blood tests and refills, my doctor wanted to do a Boston Heart test to see where I was with my future indicators of heart disease, etc. I gave some blood and then came back for the results.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was told that my cholesterol was high (something I never had before as I was a Vegan for 22 years) and I was shocked and saddened. This had only happened since taking the hormones more specifically, the Testosterone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She told me to get the book Wheat Belly and adhere to it. I did and I ate not one carbohydrate or wheat for three months. When I went back to see her, she said I gained weight. I was beside myself because I was starving myself with what the book at said to do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She said she would check my thyroid levels and sure enough she said, my thyroid was on the cusp of the normal level but descending downward for the past several years. Guess what? She put me on thyroid medicine.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I didn't trust the diagnosis so I went to a Endocrinologist and he checked my thyroid level and found nodules on my thyroid. Long story short, he said I had Hashimotos disease where my thyroid is producing antibodies that attack itself. He told me to keep taking the medication.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wow! I asked myself if this all started because I wanted slightly bigger muscles or was I actually falling apart and they were doing what they could to keep me alive (I know a little dramatic).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, I was going to have a small cosmetic procedure and the doctor said \"I can't do it you have heart problems\" after listening to my heart. I went to a heart doctor, got some seriously long and expensive tests and turns out, I have PVC'S (premature ventricular contractions) caused by the thyroid medicine. Basically, 25% of my heart doesn't beat right because I have to take thyroid medicine.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Speed up a year or so later and I'm 48 years old. I'm sitting outside in the middle of the night, naked, on my porch from being so freaking hot, I can't stand it. Of course, my doctor puts me on Estrogen and my hot flashes end but, I get fibroids and lots of liver spots from it!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By this time, I am deficient in iron from having fibroids, deficient in a ton of other stuff too. I won't go into everything that I take but I have to wonder if all of the medication is a domino effect. I think often about stopping completely to see what my body will do.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, my doctor tells to get off of gluten! She said that gluten attacks the thyroid like an allergen. Well you can probably guess that I got off of gluten and now I'm on month three.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do I feel any better? I don't think so. I have lost a few pounds and that's good.

\u00a0I had no appreciation for literally, the journey along the way.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That changed when on the way back from our weekend, I don't know if the others were tired or just quietly morning the fact that we were heading back to our everyday lives but, it was silent the whole way back.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was able to think about my life, see the sun setting, see how beautiful the trees actually were and I got to be alone with my thoughts even in the company of others.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had many real moments where I felt waves of both sadness and happiness come over me.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm turning 50 in a couple of months and I'm realizing that I have to make some significant changes in my life that will make my life very uncomfortable for a while but, in the end, the changes are just what I've needed to make me happy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Funny how we fight our thoughts and justify our lives because we go through the day to day motions, filling our spirits with being busy so that maybe, we won't have to make the decisions that are staring us in the face or whispering in our ear each day.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's easy to go on living in a comfort zone that we're used to because being comfortable feels so good and it's warm even if, it's actually the worst thing for us.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a very long time my spirit was dying and it was screaming for help but I just wouldn't listen to it. \u00a0I pushed the voice down and told myself to shut up and appreciate the life that I had.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although I appreciate my life and I know others would love to have my life, I also know that right now I have choices and I don't have to be guilty about wanting to be happy. \u00a0The biggest epiphany that I had was realizing that I can't make others happy. \u00a0I can only make myself. \u00a0Something I have not done in about ten years.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I've always felt responsible for making others happy but I didn't realize that until I took my road trip. \u00a0The cost was more that the money I had left at the casino and I decided I wasn't going to pay for the rest of my life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don't get anything else from this blog post, please know and take that statement to heart. \u00a0\"You can't make others happy.\" And, you are not responsible for making others happy either. \u00a0All you can do is be kind and be yourself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes all you need is a good road trip to get you thinking about life!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!

Only to bounce back and forth for what seems like a time in my life that will be a long road of uncertainty.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I've come to realize that, what ever the long term decision I make, I won't make it too quick and if that means to others that I'm sitting on the fence, then I'll sit on the fence for just a bit longer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have always believed that while going through rough times, we can either wallow in the pain and ask why me (and believe me I know that grieving any type of loss is normal and should happen) there are moments that creep into my mind that ask another question and that is \"now what are you going to do about it?\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which brings me to the whole point of this blog post. \u00a0Why do I let my mind tell me how or direct how, I feel each day?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When times are good I feel great and the sadness and worry no longer enter my mind but, when things take a turn for the worse, all of the fear and the \"what if\" takes over my mind and my spirit, leaving me metaphorically dragging until the next wave of hope comes along.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, I am happy again and the world is mine. \u00a0What happens when that next happy wave doesn't come? \u00a0Will I slither into a dark hole that I can't get out of? \u00a0If so then why? \u00a0Why would I let myself do that when nothing externally has changed? \u00a0People change around me but I don't and I'm realizing that this is the root cause of my pain. \u00a0I don't have to or wan't to be anything but who I am.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I am happy nothing outside me has changed just my thoughts. \u00a0When I'm down nothing outside me has changed either, just my thoughts again.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have come to realize that circumstances shouldn't dictate how I feel and how I see the world. \u00a0Controlling ones mind is not that difficult if we stop the intruding thoughts that we ourselves create. \u00a0We create bad thoughts, we create good thoughts, it's just the same. It's what we attach to those thoughts that is the issue.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember this past week driving in my Jeep (which I love to do) with the windows down, the radio blasting and feeling the cool breeze at the moment and then the next moment breaking down crying while singing along with the song on the radio. \u00a0Only then, to smile again with happiness that things aren't so bad ( by now you're probably thinking I need professional help but keep reading).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At that moment I made a commitment to myself and that was to keep that pleasant thought in my mind of being in the moment and knowing that I myself control how I feel and how I will feel from then on no matter what circumstances bring me. \u00a0I have the power, I always have and I always will..<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The statement \"change your thoughts, change your life\" couldn't be more true :)<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created \u201cThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.\u201d In just seven<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!

I say new because it\u2019s been hacked and shut down twice!\u00a0 I won\u2019t go into why but I will say it\u2019s because I let others have control and today I decided to make a new start with me being the one in control.\u00a0 Kind of like the epiphany of my life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This blog and website is about aging well.\u00a0 I\u2019m not talking about being twenty again or doing things to your body that are counter intuitive to aging and being well but, what I will write about what I\u2019m passionate about and that is aging well and living a passionate life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At times, I will talk about things that may seem a little vain because hell, I\u2019m trying like everyone else to make the transition into aging and accepting it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though aging is not very easy on the body and in a world full of marketers that have forgotten about us middle age and older people, there is a place within our spirit that we can carve out and make aging a place in time where we can feel good, both mentally and physically.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do I want to live to be 100!\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Maybe I do if I look okay and my body doesn\u2019t break down.\u00a0 I do know one thing for certain and that is that I don\u2019t want to be depending on someone, especially my kids to take care of me so, my writing here will be about all of the things that we deal with while getting older and how to take care of our mind, body and spirit, the best that we can without being too rigid in the process.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have to live and I won\u2019t stop drinking my wine no matter what my doctor or anyone else says!\u00a0 Those who know me also know this about me too.\u00a0 That\u2019s the thing.\u00a0 There comes a certain point and time in our lives that we become who WE want to be and with the courage, WE actually live the kind of life that WE want to and not what other expect us to.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this point in life, I don\u2019t want to tell others how to live and I sure as hell don\u2019t want them to tell me how to live my life because frankly, I really don\u2019t care.\u00a0 Those times are behind me and I won\u2019t look back because, I\u2019m not going that way anymore.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I hope to bring you inspiration, reference, ideas, laughs and, videos of those who are living and aging well and topics that are helpful.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will leave you with something:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cEnjoy your body, Use it every way you can...
